8msp9v,dzq7pnu,BoozeMeUpScotty,"Yayyyy!!! Good for you! This is my favorite kind of post to see‚Äîanywhere!
I work in inpatient mental health and it might sound weird, but I LOVE when I have the chance to work with ‚Äúyounger‚Äù patients‚Äîlike 35 and under‚Äîbecause they tend to be the group that has the best likelihood of a good outcome. It‚Äôs the group that usually has the strongest support system, the most resilience, and most importantly, deep down, the most hope for the future...which is how you end up with a post like this. 

It‚Äôs so great to see that even though things haven‚Äôt come easily to you that you didn‚Äôt give up and you fought through the roughest moments and that you accomplished such an amazing goal. And it‚Äôs admirable that you took the steps to care for yourself when you were in crisis‚Äî*at least* 8 times (wowza, x8!)‚Äîand to do what you needed to to get back on your feet. I know you know that this doesn‚Äôt mean the hard times are over and that there will be periods in your life where things get hard again. And I hope that you remember in the back of your mind that you‚Äôve made it back over and over and no matter how difficult it might seem in that moment, that you have it in you to make it back again‚Äîand *again* and *again* if it comes down to that. You‚Äôre strong and smart and clearly a fighter. Don‚Äôt forget those things and don‚Äôt forget this moment. 

Keep building your support system while you‚Äôre in this good place and keep utilizing the resources that have worked for you in a preventative way, to *keep* yourself as healthy as possible. Know and remember the signs of a relapse and don‚Äôt be afraid to get help again at the first sign of trouble. Strong people don‚Äôt *not* need help‚Äîstrong people reach for it at the first sign of needing it. Strong people use what they‚Äôve learned to help themselves and rally for themselves and to *stay* strong and brave even when that means taking breaks to care for themselves or having moments/days/weeks/months/years of struggle. 
Speaking out about what you‚Äôve been through is so admirable and it‚Äôll surely mean a lot to other people who are struggling and who think they‚Äôll never be able to fight their mental health issues enough to reach their own goals. Being honest like this will help you stay accountable with yourself and your mental health and will bring you an even larger support system. You have it in you to make such a positive impact on your own life *and* the lives of others. I hope you continue to speak out and to maybe even get involved with some mental health organizations/groups to spread your positivity/encouragement and be around like-minded, mental health stigma-breakers like yourself.
You have what it takes to fight this and to keep triumphing over it. I wish you the very best! Congrats and keep kicking ass! :)",9,1527542471.0,t3_8msp9v,False

I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre an incredible parent and I know you‚Äôll take good care of your kids through this emotional time

It‚Äôs ok to be strong for them, it‚Äôs also ok to cry it out. The pain is a natural part in the cycle of suffering sudden death brings on. Every wave of grief and anger is normal to struggle with and some strange unusual emotions may get tossed in as well.

Now is the time to seek consolation and lean on your support systems, now is the time to enroll in therapy to help you heal so that you have the tools to help your children heal.

Of course finances are a big worry, even if she didn‚Äôt have a life insurance policy I‚Äôm sure your family can help stabilize things until the next best option becomes apparent.

I know we live in a world where money is king but prioritize your emotional health and that of your kids for right now, don‚Äôt let them see your fear of the future. It‚Äôs ok for them to know how grieved you are over how much you loved her but they need to feel stability in their home life even if that means moving around a bit.

The present feels like the worst possible thing that could ever happen has happened, you‚Äôll be the strongest you‚Äôve ever been emotionally after working through this. And even though it sounds crazy to even consider at this point you will find someone to share affection with who can help you coparent again.

The love and memories that you shared with her are eternal and can‚Äôt ever be disrupted just because your story with her was cut short. You will always have the early chapters to reread and there will be new chapters to write even if that answer isn‚Äôt satisfying because you want and miss that person.

Love is an infinite resource, take advantage of the other sources of love in your life and give it freely, as frightening as it may be you can never lose it. 

Everything will be ok even if it isn‚Äôt right now, reach out if you need to talk

r84f46,hn3rl25,itssodamnnoisy,"I'm an afghanistan vet. I tell you this because you are feeling the very same way I felt when I came home. So if its ok, I'd like to offer you my advice on trauma. 

You need to know that your experience was terrifying. Earth-shattering. World-rocking and security-robbing and you're now asking yourself questions that nobody should have to ask themselves, ever. I want you to know that nothing that happened is your fault. You aren't to blame.  You're not a bad person for surviving. You don't have a thing to feel guilty for in all of this, so try not to. I know it's hard. Think of guilt like a heavy weight. This weight is not yours to carry. Try not to carry it too long.

Right now, how you feel is raw and new, like a broken bone. Only so much worse. But, just like a broken bone, it'll slowly start to hurt less, day after day.  What you're feeling right now I think is a healthy and normal reaction. I know it doesn't feel like it, but you're going to be ok. Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow. But someday.

Give yourself time to heal. You don't have to feel normal until you're ready, so don't try to rush back to how things were. It's going to take time. I suggest talking. Surround yourself with family and friends. Talk out how you feel with people you love and trust and who love and trust you back. If you aren't ready or up to do that, writing letters helps me sometimes.

When you start feeling a little better (not before, don't rush it!) I'd say start picking up things that you like first. Do you like art? Paint yourself a little something thats for your eyes only. Nobody else ever has to see it if you don't want. Music, same thing. The idea is, when you're ready, give yourself a way to express how you feel.

It's going to be ok. You aren't to blame. Take it slow, and one day at a time. Sending all the support and care your way. Hang in there. Oh, and therapy helps! It really does!",862,1638559588.0,t3_r84f46,False

Remind yourself when you ask yourself these things that you don't need an answer for them. You may find yourself feeling that you don't deserve to feel bad because you survived but I assure you that it is okay to feel sadness, anger, and whatever else yo may feel. The more you internalise this experience the worse it will get so seek help as soon as possible and don't think that you should just move on with your life.

1iql0xw,md1tlel,anxious_cat_grandpa,"Guys, remember that we (men) are the difference makers in this situation. We all need to provide an example of positive masculinity for all other men and, especially, boys out there. They need to see that being a man should mean something other than being a selfish asshole. They need to see that it is truly more rewarding to be a man who respects the agency of all other people equally, who recognizes the historical and contemporary oppression of women in society, who represents true strength, which is the strength of your character. 

Being good and being strong are synonymous in this context, imo. Misogynistic people don't address their own shortcomings, instead blaming femininity, or else the collective of all women outright. They are weak and stupid because they have been dominated internally by their own insecurities and gender dysphoria. They are *jealous* of women, in a way. Part of them deep inside envies the level of attention and objectification women are subject to. And here is the dark truth at the heart of it all: the social construct known as gender is what puts men and women (and enbies) in a position to hate one another because it is literally a divisive category. Women are not essentially different from men. We can point to primary and secondary sex characteristics, of course, but these things don't determine your character and choices.

What I believe the best thing to do is (it may not be the best, I‚Äôm not a phycologist) is to literally do at least something close to what you want to achieve that night that will effect you the next day or take away the distraction. For me, that was deleting social media off my phone as well as all the games I had. The next day I started getting upset and stayed in my room (probably withdrawal symptoms) but because I already deleted my games, I didn‚Äôt need to worry about doing anything extreme and the day after I was able to study again. This obviously isn‚Äôt the same as something like alcoholism but I feel it could apply to anything. Getting rid of what‚Äôs holding you back (at least temporarily) will help push you towards what you want to achieve. The next 3 am you get I think you should do this (although it may not be the same for certain situations, respond if there‚Äôs a problem). You can guarantee you will be happier in the long run",44,1612867920.0,t3_lfysvh,False

**The general approach to Psychiatric/Phycological (psychosocial) first-aid!**

**Patient approach: verbal de-escalating and your role as psychosocial first-aider.** 

Your role as a psychosocial first-aiders is to make the patient feel safe; heard; seen; respected; and in general feel that you are there to help them, you should not form any thoughts about diagnoses (that‚Äôs a doctor with the proper education and experience‚Äôs job (usually a Psychiatrist)) or try to be their therapist, nor should you make promises or set expectations as that can make the treatment more difficult. 

You should to the best of your ability use de-escalation techniques and to avoid physical intervention (use of force), if the patient is considered a danger to themselves or others you should contact the police for assistance.

**The general approach:** Psychiatric (psychosocial) first-aid is extremely important, and there are some steps you follow:  


1. **Assess the situation** \- As soon as possible, you must check your surroundings for dangers to your own safety and that of others and take preventative measures to ensure that you remain safe, this includes **contacting your local EMS** (do not hang up on EMS unless they tell you to and give feedback as you go along, as well as rely on them for guidance if you are unsure. EMS is your best friend in any healthcare emergency, use them for what they are worth). - it might sound egoistic but it's important that you as a caregiver are safe so you can provide the assistance and help needed without the danger of being harmed.   

2. **Contact and engagement** \- talk to the patient in a non-confronting manner and actively listen to them, do not try to argue against them as that can escalate their frustration. Instead try to understand that they could be in acute distress; worried; psychotic/delusional or scared (depending on what the crisis is). If you come off as confrontive or judgemental the patient can quickly become defensive and reluctant to assistance/treatment, or become hostile and potentially a danger to themselves or others (such as the first-aider trying to help them).  

3. **Safety and comfort** \- respect, patience, and understanding are needed. Make sure they are in a safe environment where they feel comfortable, if possible stay with them and try to be comforting by showing them that you're there and they are being taken care of and aren't in any danger. Do not restrain them, you quickly run the risk of harming them; yourself and/or causing them to become hostile, let the proper personnel restrain them (e.g Police).  

4. **Stabilization** \- use distraction techniques, such as talking with them about their interests; hobbies; have them tell you a story or engage in other topics that take the focus away from the crisis.  

5. **Information gathering** \- get as much information about their condition as possible, pay attention to their mood and behaviour (this could be important for EMS and should be relayed back to your local EMS). If there are other people present who know the patient you can ask if the patient is known to have the symptoms/crisis and if they have a treatment plan or use any medication (\*\*DO NOT\*\* give any medications without being explicitly told so by qualified healthcare personnel, which rarely, if ever, happens).  

6. **Practical assistance** \- help them if there's anything they need or if they struggle with obtaining their basic needs. Provide physical and emotional stability, and offer practical assistance, such as: giving them water if thirsty; blanket if they are cold; or other practical help that can make them more comfortable.  

7. **Connections** \- reach out to those you believe can help them, for example: ask if there is anyone they would like for you to call/reach out to, such as: family; friends; or others who they feel confident in and that will be supportive. 

Be mindful about who you involve as they need to be able to de-escalate and not provoke them, this includes those around you; unless there is someone who is either trained in psychosocial first-aid or personally knows the patient, then having them leave the scene is your go-to. The fewer people (bystanders) the better, it‚Äôs a high pressure situation for both the patient and you as care-giver, and having bystanders is not only a distraction but can be potentially aggravating for the patient (This goes back to point 1. Assessing the situation and taking preventative measures to ensure everyone's safety. As well as point 3. Safety and comfort, having a lot of people around may be distressing).

**Remember** that you as a psychosocial first-aider is **not** a therapist, nor is it your job to act as one or try to treat them beyond your capabilities (this includes not assuming diagnoses; suggesting path of treatment; or suggest medication). - **As mentioned:** It can make it difficult for EMS and an eventual therapist/treatment team to work with them if you have created expectations or made promises.",156,1744234517.0,t3_1jvfg1t,False

1felvyg,lmosxp4,staring-at-the-void,"What you're experiencing is probably dissociation, and it's most likely the only possible human response to the horrors that you've seen. Your nervous system had to shut off everything happening around you and not perceive it in order to survive the emotional burden. Now that you subconsciously isolated your feelings for so long, you don't know how to feel or care anymore. And that's totally normal. People have that response for way smaller trauma. You'll probably need a lot of therapy to hopefully recover a bit in this lifetime. But it's totally understandable that your brain never wants to feel or perceive anything ever again.

You should also not blame yourself for not feeling as good as you hoped now that you're safe. The anticipation of the relief that you thought you would feel is what your mind fed you in order to survive and survival is our strongest instinct (which can be frustrating in this world, because often it feels not worth it to survive, especially with the things you've seen). You were in a situation of extreme and prolonged stress and shock, in a state of emergency, so your body and mind will need a long time to recover. They need a break. Our human minds didn't evolve to handle these atrocities and this level of destruction.

Take it slow, one step at a time, just look at the close way forward and know that your feeling of numbness is valid. You need to give your brain time and when you're ready, seek therapy, even though it will be a long process to find a qualified therapist on this topic, few people can remotely relate to what you went through and their suggestions will sound tone deaf to you. Probably a therapist that specializes in PTSD could be good. 

Maybe also try to express your feelings to people who experienced the same thing and escaped, if you know any. They will understand you better than anyone. All of us here cannot imagine what you went through. At some point you might even feel survivor's guilt. But just know that you didn't deserve to get your humanity taken away like this. So try to get it back, at least a small portion of what you used to be. It's a matter of justice, it was stolen from you and you deserve it back. But give it time, don't try to force it.

I won't lie to you, it will be really hard for some time Now, but you are not alone you have your family beside you, your Son who needs you and all of us if you ever need anything. Try to spend more time with friends and try to distract yourself (you probably won't be able to, but please, don't stop trying).

Sleeping will be a real trouble now. So before any meds, try other ways. Get yourself tired, do some sport (idealy with friends) or do some workout daily (20 minutes should be enough for begging, you can of course extend it). Some bike or walk trips should be really helpful (try with others then you will know if it's better with them or alone). Music always distract me a bit at least.

Try art, actively or passively, whatever fits you, you may find understanding and peace in it also joy and many other positive emotions.

Holy Hell by Architects is amazing album. It's about death of close one, but you find much more than pain there (in a good way). But I am not sure if you like this kind of music... metalcore.

Be sure to not get closed and cold, it would be a huge complication.

845g11,dvmvzru,krishowson,"today i am officially five years self harm free. 

it is very hard for me to be open and honest with people about how i used to cut/burn/scratch/you name it, i probably did it, to myself. 

i stayed silent about my fight with depression & suicidal thoughts (among a list of other things) for years. this made things so much worse for me, by bottling it up and keeping it to myself, i (me, myself & my mental health) got worse & that is exactly why we have to have open & non-judgemental conversations about this kind of thing. because no one, not even my worst enemy, should have to ever feel like the only way they can get relief, is by hurting themselves. 

it has not been an easy five years. in fact, the past five years of my life have been the hardest, the darkest, and the most gruelling five years. i lost count of how many times i came very close to throwing it all away, but i am such a strong believer that how you survive is what makes you who you are. and so instead of taking the easy way out, i fought, i held myself back, i survived, & now it has been a full five years. 

this picture was taken a few days after the last time i cut myself. you‚Äôd never ever know though, don‚Äôt i look so happy? can‚Äôt you almost hear my laugh through the photo? 
moral is, you never truly know what‚Äôs going on in someone‚Äôs life. be kind to everyone you meet, every single person i struggling, & just because they‚Äôre smiling doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre happy. 
keep an open mind, and an open heart. you never know who you‚Äôll inadvertently help.  

thank you to everyone who has supported me, past & present. thank you to my parents who got me the support i needed after my assault. thank you to anyone who believed me when i said it was the cat... despite me not actually having a cat at the time. it made it less awkward for me since i wasn‚Äôt ready to talk about it. thank you to anyone and everyone who has had my back during these five years. thank you for listening, giving advice, for wiping my tears, giving me back tickles to calm me down, for not judging me, for being kind to me, and for sticking around through it all to see it through with me to the other side. you‚Äôre stronger than i and i hope one day, maybe when it‚Äôs been 10 years of me being self harm free, i can say i‚Äôm as strong as you. thank you.

At the start of my freshman year of high school when the new dance season started, which would have been my 10th, I just remember one day waking up and suddenly I wasn‚Äôt excited to go to dance anymore. Of course there were always some days where I didn‚Äôt want to because I was tired but this was different. When I thought about dance I didn‚Äôt get the same feeling I did before. I remember crying to my dad in the car and saying I didn‚Äôt want to anymore. I couldn‚Äôt understand why. I was so upset to give it up, reaching the 10 year milestone in my studio was a big deal, they gave you a special shoutout during the recitals and everything. I couldn‚Äôt wait for the day I was a senior in high school and I got to do the special dance with the other high school seniors to honor them as we ‚Äúgraduated‚Äù from the studio. And then one day I just... didn‚Äôt care anymore. Looking back I know now it was because I was in the height of my depression. I became severely depressed in 8th grade, although I had signs of depression and anxiety for much much longer. I still miss it a lot and one day I hope to take some adult classes once a week just to do it again but I‚Äôll never get back to the level I was before and that makes me so sad because I worked so hard to get to that point.

There's always a REASON behind what we perceive as laziness but there isn't a single person on earth who genuinely wants to fail or not do the things they have to or were told to do. The idea behind laziness is that someone who is lazy is choosing not to do something purposefully and without reason other than it's part of their personality but like you've said, it's depression, anxiety, executive dysfunction, or something else.

It's not about time efficency because if I could I would order home delivery pizza or something which would take like 1 hour and also cost money. I just wanna put in as little effort as possible for any result. This is laziness. To be motivated exclusively by mimimal effort even when the desired result would be different is the core of laziness. 

I think the better question is whether or not it is inherently bad and the answer to that is of course, no it's not. It's a morally ambiguous trait that can lead to bad results. Bad being harmful in this context. It can lead to neutral results and even good results.",4,1658282253.0,t3_w2yu1n,False

You'd have to find something special in the area of ""phenomenology"", but something designed for therapy or something. I'm thinking that your mind got dislodged but didn't find any footing on good concepts to help you organize your reality. You'd have to be careful about what philosophy to look into. 

You probably don't realize how many concepts are involved in just being. Even your ""ego death"", a common term that is used, is really a concept, and it might not actually be a very good one, though there's probably something to it. But the very idea of ""ego"" is weird and complicated. You could take this all as a journey, but you can't just go to some commune, follow a guru, or pick up just any idea and run with it. But it's like your ""ego"" is kind of freed up but actually has no concepts to help you figure things out.

vkyv5m,idu2mkz,illGiveYou2,"Before my soul kitty, Binx, passed away from a congenital kidney disease, he used to lay on top of me at night almost like he was protecting me. I lived alone at the time and I got very lonely and depressed, and often cried myself to sleep. It was me and Binx against the world. 

I loved that cat so much and I know he loved me. He was in critical care at the vet for a couple of days for blood tests and evaluation. They said he hadn't peed the entire time. I walked in to see him and immediately he stood up and peed in his box. The tech said she had tried to help him stand up and go the whole day and he just wanted to lay there until he saw me. 

I remember when it was time to say goodbye, the vet let me take him home for one last night. He and I slept in the bathroom floor together away from the other cats. I just laid there crying and holding him. Angry that this was happening to him and hating myself for what I had to do the next day even though it was what was best for him. 

I remember that he was having trouble walking and he wouldn't eat or drink. I got really upset and just lost it. He got up and walked over to me and nudged me with his head and climbed into my lap. I can still see his little face looking up at me. He was pushing himself to his limit to make sure I was ok. That's the moment I realized he was hanging on for me. And that wasn't fair. 

I've always loved my cats and I always will. But Binx was special. He came into my life as a scrawny abandoned stray and when he left, he took a piece of me with him.

I'm saying all of this because you need to know that your kitty did that for a reason. Out of unconditional love and care for you.

I‚Äôve been in my head all month thinking about how I am here now, an age I never expected to see. Cancer still haunts me. it ruined my life in so many ways. it changed the way i view everything (relationships, sex, friends, family, time, health, money, my ‚Äúpurpose‚Äù and more) permanently, in devastatingly negative and some positive ways. However, the last few years, i‚Äôve learned to become so grateful. My eyes are so open to life now, moreso than so many people I‚Äôve met. 

Yes, the horrors and terrifying twists of possible fate are unblinded to me now , and plague me with fear and apathy, but I also find myself cherishing small, banal things more than anyone I know. I sit in my car and appreciate getting to see the moon again tonight, hear rain, step in a puddle, i get home and take my wet socks off mildly annoyed, and smile because I still can. 

I don‚Äôt know if this helps in any way. You faced terror and mortality young too. far too young. But try to believe it will let you enjoy your time left with more flavor and intensity than anyone else. Love pain and hard times and good times and neutral, boring times because you still can. Love going to the grocery store because you get to. Try to believe you will smile at these stupid things one day. Much love.

Mental Health is about finding evidence based practices, engaging in a dialog regarding treatment, discussing natural supports and their utilization, supporting suicide prevention plans, advocating for social change in society, taking personal accountability for choices, supporting empowerment through encouragement and challenges, growing didactic conversations rather than throwing out basic ass complaints about how other people are ""ruining"" your expirence.

She made me realize that there are genuinely good people on this Earth after a good 7 years of bullying and trauma that caused me to gain weight, fall into a depression, and suffer to the point of PTSD attacks.  

My former reason to live was my intense sense of empathy towards others and my belief of ""if I'm gone, that's one less hand to help people"" always put others first, even if it hurt me drastically, even if they were rude.  It made me feel something.

Your unconscious will go to extreme lengths to protect yourself from ostracism (think evolutionarily; you're fighting for survival), but it is so strong your assumptions as to where you 'stand' are so pessimistic that it is really difficult to challenge them.

""The so-called ‚Äòpsychotically depressed‚Äô person who tries to kill herself doesn‚Äôt do so out of quote ‚Äòhopelessness‚Äô or any abstract conviction that life‚Äôs assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise.

Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire‚Äôs flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It‚Äôs not desiring the fall; it‚Äôs terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt!‚Äô and ‚ÄòHang on!‚Äô, can understand the jump. Not really. You‚Äôd have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.""

My daughter adopted a male 1 yr old kitty about 6 years ago. That did nothing to change my mind. He didn‚Äôt want you to touch him, only came around for food, and was kind of a jerk.

But he did change the last couple of years. Started to like being petted. A lot more sociable.

But the remarkable thing was, when I was sad, he would come over and nudge me with his little nose, as if trying to distract me. When I was crying, he would kind of nest up in the crook of my arm and stay until I stopped.

It kind of blew my mind how much empathy I could feel from him. My daughter moved away a couple months ago and took him with her. I miss him so much.

But that doesn't mean they help with anything besides just stabilization.  The real work is comes from the person themselves with life changes, therapy, keeping good relationships and changing or leaving bad ones, processing and healing from trauma, sleep schedule, meaningful activity, pursuing dreams and aspirations, processing and recovering from social anxiety, etc.  Meds don't do any of that for a person.  

&#x200B;

So what I see as a mental health advocate is a very scary thing in the world where people are led to believe that meds will automatically cure their suffering.  And they don't work that way.  So when the discussions all focus on med compliance and ignore the work that has to be done, people don't get better no matter how much medication they take.

It takes guts to take meds in today's sick sad society that views taking psych meds as a weakness.

It sounds like you need to take baby steps to a more wholesome lifestyle. Start off just working out, and in your spare time just rest and relax.

grs4po,fs137pw,Reviryu,"What an outstanding thought process. 

Truly, you should be proud of yourself. Think about this: despite your back pain, despite how horrible you felt on THIS day, you stood at the bell. Even though it felt impossible, you got up, you went through the motions, and you tried today. I'm proud of you.

But do you know what's even better? The ending. The fact that you realize that you need to change; now THAT'S where it resonates. That's the concept that will start to change you. The guilt you feel knowing that you could have done better is there to HELP YOU change. Listen to it, but don't hold onto it. There's no need. Accept that you have the potential to feel happy, to live with good health, and to be satisfied when your head hits the pillow. It will happen.

You know what to do, and you know it will be difficult. But the reason you feel this way is because you deserve better. I'm so sorry that you have to deal with back pain, and I can't imagine the difficulty that comes from the pain meds. I do know just like so many others that you can get through this, and it sounds like you know it too. Just take that first baby step, whatever it may be. A day without alcohol, a nice mile jog, a walk, eating clean for a meal, whatever. Get after it.

Trust me, we all like easy things, and yes, life can be dreadfully hard sometimes. But the harder you try at the beginning with those little victories, the easier the routine gets, the happier you become.   


I know it doesn't feel like it, but if you sublimate the pain you felt today and use it make tomorrow better, then today was a victory.

And you don't even start doing it because you know it's not going to be ""good enough""? That's some kind of procrastination type, but hear this, you're so aware you have to do the right thing, - but know you may not do it perfectly - and you don't do it at all. Because is better not doing it at all than dissapoiting yourself for performing it poorly, right? Lemme free you from that guilt. Maybe you didn't eat healthy all day, but you made yourself some fruit with yogurt and oats and juice, and ate a good dinner. Half good, right? But it's enough, tomorrow maybe you could eat a healthy breakfast and then got low on energy and then just ate doritos. But it's fine, keep trying. The next day you cooked for three days, ate good breakfast and you didn't ate late. That's perfect ! Maybe it wasn't the fanciest meal, who cares? You're surviving, you're getting better, perfect performance can go to shit. Be proud of everything you do.

Did 10 minutes of work out, couldnt move at all, got tired inmeadiatly, maybe I made that excercise wrong. WHO CARES? It's much better than nothing at all. Your body learns, it accomodates, you become more awake, your breathing gets stronger, next day you did twenty minutes with some music that keept you motivated, your body is in the floor, your heart aches, you breathing is heavier, it might be painful, but it reminds you that you're alive, it's amazing you can feel all of these little tingles in your body, right? Feel yourself, you own this.

Forgive yourself, accept your depression, move on, slowly, fail, fail again, try again, get reminded you're alive, that little moment of blessing was worth all the effort. Then try again, those little moments keep accumulating, then everything feels like it makes you aware you're alive, you don't even have to try, or overthinking it too much, and even reaching this point, you may fail again, but it's ok ! You're human and trying and you have every right to keep trying.

For the first time in my life I really felt like I had a handle on keeping track of everything because of that planner.

Then covid happened, and the planner I'd gotten for this year suddenly felt almost meaningless. Everything was up in the air. Schedules were made up and the points didn't matter. I'm trying very hard to get back into my good habits again, but it's a struggle.

It's more of an executive functioning thing for me, I literally can't do things consistently or focus sometimes, I get irritated due to depression. You are not alone, and the reason you probably asked the question is because like me you were insecure at one point in time about it.

It could be: 
Stress and cortisol due to everyday life. With a person that has mental illness it exacerbates the symptoms of stress. Everyone gets stressed, but few tend to understand that mental illness actually makes some people actually seem straight forgetful, disorganized, irritated, tired and can also give people coordination issues. 

I have some weird chronic fatigue issues with depression and it makes everything terrible. People have actually told me about my memory issues and it makes me very insecure. Now people can run their mouths all day about advice, but really the best thing you can do is to slowly recover through multiple ways:

- Sleep health is very important.
- Vitamins and nutrition
- Lower stress and meditate
- Exercise
- Don't isolate yourself, this can actually have drastic effects on your functioning.
- Find soft hobbies or companies, maybe pets to occupy or stimulate your mind
- Self compassion

Now worst is that you don't feel anything, but it can only help. And yes I understand when people say these things are easy, especially to someone with severe anxiety, it appears somewhat disingenuous... *Did it work for them?* I would say to myself. Just don't think about it like that, you know what's best for you... With help that is... Kind of a paradox... But you get the point.

What I've learned is that there's good and bad stuff happening all the time, but the sum of our reality is truly amazing. The case of our existence, organisms composed by elements from space through 13.8 billion years, are still evolving and expanding.

I sometimes imagine a ""timelapse"" of earth and the moon next too each other through time. Suddenly a small metal container exits earths atmosphere, headed for the moon with apes inside clicking buttons. For the fun of it, imagine our universe is some kind of simulation done by intelligence that returns to check the results, saying ""What the hell is going on here...""

The nature of our reality‚Äîa complex mathematical equation of particles‚Äîhas gotten to the point where it asks questions about its existence. Asking questions like ""Where do we come from? What are the rules of the universe?"" is like a program realizing it's a program, not knowing how it started and where and when it ends.

I don't think our world is depressing at all.

I'm betting we are much safer today than those who lived 100.000 years ago, 2.000 years ago and 200 years ago.

In 2013, when I was 25/26, I had just graduated from Columbia with my Masters. So many of my peers already had so much more work experience and got great job offers. I tried to stay in NY but ended up going back home to CA bc I couldn't afford to stay. Within months of graduating, my dad almost died (complications of diabetes) and he and I moved in with my grandmother so we could care for him. I entered a deep depression. I thought I'd never find a job and would have to care for my father the rest of his life. Seeing the man who raised me look so frail and fall into a deep depression himself was devastating to say the least. I was crying nearly every day and stopped taking care of myself.

Eventually, I started to pull myself out of it with some help from a grad school friend. It took me months to finally get a job and then nearly a year to finally get a job somewhat related to my degree. 7 years after graduating and I'm near getting my professional license. And I live in an amazing apartment with a great boyfriend.

Trust me when I say: your time will come. The WORST thing you can do is compare yourself with others. I'd recommend a social media detox. For one thing, people only broadcast the best part of their lives...rarely do people share their struggles. Another thing is, if you spend less time looking at how others live you can focus on how you live.

Take care.",66,1600585776.0,t3_iw7cul,False

Have you tried speaking to any of these people about how you're feeling? you might get some much needed insight! Also, social media exacerbates this. everyone is posting about all their achievements, all the things they have and all the tings they are doing. what you don't see is that them and their partner are fighting everyday, the car that they post endless photos of  is on finance that they can barely afford and there are other stresses they have to go through everyday.

I have talked about this, used it as examples, joked about it, and it's just because it's so strange it's hard to process and let go of. 

I have a female friend of mine who I think it the smartest and funniest woman I have ever met. However, she ""likes"" being addicted to drugs. She has been raped countless times, and once she passed out in a trap house and woke up to being gangraped, and asked the guys for money, according to her. She is also a street prostitute in this horrible part of town called Kensington in Philly. 

She grew up with bikers in her family than had her on drugs by 8 years old, and ""sold"" her for other things. I know her mom that was part of it and so forth. So, I get she has massive trauma an is the product of that. 

However, she is smart, gives excellent advice, is philosophical, and can keep up with me in a discussion which I respect greatly. However, all the stuff I just mentioned plays on my mind when I speaking to her sometimes. I'm like, I love this person and admire her----but maybe she's crazy!! 

That's an extreme example, but I'm used to extreme situations. Most people are not and so when they know you have a mental health problem, it's like saying you're radioactive, and they can't stop thinking about it.

When I'm in my darkest places I remember the days like you just mentioned. The days where being alive felt good. I remind myself that those days can and will come again if I keep going.

You know how in some parts of the world they can go a long period of time without the sun? For people that don't have mental health struggles the sun rises and sets on a more regular schedule. For people like us that struggle, we're more like the town in Alaska that can go 67 days without sun. But no matter what, the sun comes back.

n04hab,gw55nbu,bolognie1,"Man good news!

I just want to say one thing that has opened my eyes a lot, and may be interesting.

Firstly, as intelligent, self-aware beings, it only makes sense to me that suicide should be a natural choice.  It appears to me that our right to death is as important, if not even more so, than our right to life.  I think in almost all cases, the decision to die is often made hastily and out of temporary emotional distress, and is (as you point out here) most likely a mistake.

I say this just because I think the subject should be approached differently than it is in society today.  It is not wrong to kill yourself, but it is also not any better than just simply being.  I think it is something I may have heard from Alan Watts in his lectures on zen that the spirit world/ death just isn't viewed as any different from life.  Anyway, the last thing I want to say leads on from this which is that living in the present moment is a retreat.  Practising mindfulness, breathing, is something that has been revolutionary to me.  It really helps gain a third-person perspective on your life and realise that your emotions are just emotions - they guide you, but they *are not* you.  Listening to guys like Thich Naht Hanh on his monestary's youtube channel Plum Village has been really useful for me this past year.

Personally I got off antidepressants around a year ago because they seemed to make it worse, and being more mindful and physically active seemed to work for me, but if that's what works for you then keep it up.  Just know there are more options, and more routes to health.  Life's an ongoing, individual experience.  Your psychiatrist doesn't have all the answers either, only their own.  It took me a while to realise the best solution for me was to leave (medicated) psychiatry, it just wasn't an effective tool.",3,1619589553.0,t3_n04hab,False

A year later, the cats previous owner got in touch and asked me if I'd take the cats mum too. So now I have two cats, despite never actually setting out to have even one cat.  
   
The bond I have with these two girls is so precious. I couldn't have done lockdown without them. I've been mostly on my own for the last 7 months, and yet every day they give me a reason to wake up, get out of bed, talk out loud to someone, smile, laugh, and get in touch with friends  and family by sending them pics.  
    
People who say cats are assholes who don't love you, don't really understand cats if you ask me. My cats adore me, and I adore them. It sounds dramatic, but some days I feel like I'd protect them as if they were my own children (I don't have children so I can't compare the feeling, but I imagine this is how it feels).

7z643i,dulojol,SomeFuckingWords,"This is pretty misleading because it gives people the idea that their problems will magically disappear if they take medication. It doesn't work like that. Medication may or may not work at all, it also may have terrible side-effects or it may not. It is always worth trying but as a way to help get you out of the rut you're stuck in, not as some kind of life-style that you want to adopt because you think mental-illness is cool.

Some people take medication for years and get nowhere, some people who don't take medication but try therapy manage to improve their life considerably. It all depends on the individual and misleading people like this is only going to make their choice much more confusing and more difficult to make. Your experience is only one of many, many experiences and a lot of them will have *very* different results to yours.

Some things really do require medication to overcome or at least manage but depression does not. With depression, medication is just a nudge in the right direction. It doesn't solve or change any of the things that cause your depression, it just takes the edge off it which is quite helpful if you're finding it hard to change things for the better because it is less painful to do so. It also gives you a feeling that you're doing something positive so you can then go on and feel okay with doing other positive things and therefore improve your mental-health.

I've tried several different anti-depressants and honestly, some of them made me a *lot* worse and I had to come off them immediately. None of them really worked in the way you describe here, if I'm totally honest, it was the therapy that helped me and any ethical doctor will advise you to go that route rather than lining the pockets of capitalist pig-dog pharmaceutical types.",23,1519229523.0,t3_7z643i,False

The reason I think that is because how I have over come my depression and anxiety (granted still have em but I can tolerate it better) is when I decided to understand why I have it and why it is affecting me like so. Chemical make up of brain? Life experiences? Both? 

A person who doesn't know you cannot solve it for you but they can help understand and once you understand your situation you can begin to solve it. 

I am extremely happy that you got to this point in your life, it's not easy and I applaud you. And I am extremely happy that at the end of the day yes you had a therapist but it was you that helped yourself. I wish you a life time of happiness because you deserve it.

Your outlook was bleak but you were able to work through the tragedies, the loss, the hopelessness, the helplessness, the fear, and the overwhelming other feelings that you were experiencing, and move forward. You learned to believe in yourself, and love yourself. In turn with the help of your therapist, you developed coping mechanisms, and the strength to work though the trauma and overwhelming emotions to get a handle on your life. You took control and gained confidence. It's a LOT of hard work, but it sounds like you've found some peace of mind. One day at a time, every day.
Now life is good! I have a similar success story, I had a lot of help, but I did all the work. And I'm still doing the work.

i have an extremely similar story, quite scarily similar actually. my mom had her first stroke in 2015 and then 2 more as of 3 years ago. she too has been left unable to speak and paralyzed on one side. 

she was the one person in my life that i felt comfortable enough to talk to about my depression and anxiety, to the point where not even my father knew any details. then she had her strokes and i felt so lonely because i knew it was my turn to be there for her and i kept all my personal burdens pushed aside. 

i started drinking heavily on my own, abusing drugs, and watched my grades slip away. i then told my dad i wanted to attend therapy. 

this came as a shock to him because i‚Äôve always been the stubborn type but i couldn‚Äôt live with myself anymore, and after a couple suicide attempts i knew it was time to make a positive change. 

I know i‚Äôm no one to you but to see someone else with nearly the same story as mine just flipped my mindset. i‚Äôve been struggling a lot more recently and this post truly made me realize that i‚Äôm not alone in this world... so thank you again, you kind stranger.",7,1612126165.0,t3_l9ghgu,False

Something really helpful that my therapist does is kind of summarize what I've said in different words and it helps me be able to see things in another perspective - even tho it's essentially what I've just told her! Therapy can be incredibly helpful if you have healthy expectations. I avoided it for years because I had the mentality of ""I already know what's wrong I don't need anyone to tell me"" but I'm so glad I finally started that journey a few months ago. 

For me, it took finally valuing myself just enough to feel like I didn't deserve to (or HAVE to) continue suffering alone. I wish I'd been a little more open minded and tried therapy sooner but I'm glad I'm doing it now! I am actually getting my degree in psychology and I think it's helped me understand a lot more about myself as well.

I guess I also had the wrong assumption that the therapist would tell me how to solve my issues and what I should do to fix it. But that's not how it works. She just sat there and asked me some questions, then I would talk about it, which is how therapy works right? Except I felt like I have already talked about those issues to a few other people, so it was not pent up inside me anymore and just talking about it all again to another person didn't make a difference. I guess I was expecting more insight and more solutions from her, she is the professional after all. I didn't get any of that. I basically just told the same stories to myself and she nodded. So I quit. It was also pretty expensive, which I think it's ridiculous. It should not break your wallet to try to get better. You know what helped me a bit(and more than her)? Reddit!

I started seeing my psychologist last year after getting sick and tired of years of persistent, mild and sometimes severe, depression. As somewhat of an armchair psychologist myself, I thought I had myself pretty much figured out but decided it would be helpful to talk to someone objective, so I started seeing her. 

Turns out... my depression is actually a symptom of un-diagnosed ADHD. And a lot of the negative thoughts and emotions that drive the depression are actually anxiety, which is also a symptom of my ADHD. 

Literally all of the things you listed off here - that's me! And what makes this whole thing even funnier is that I have spent the last couple of years concerned about my fiance's anxiety, without ever realizing that *I* too was suffering a different kind of anxiety! 

Back to you now - are you working with a therapist at all? If not, I'd recommend that you do at least a few sessions. They will be able to help you sort out where these anxiety issues are coming from and you may be surprised at what they come up with. With all the resources online about mental health, it's pretty easy to figure out when you have a problem, and it's easy to find a label to put to that problem, but it takes a professional to really figure out what is a symptom, what is a cause, and the best way for you to move forward.

I used to be so eager to make fiends but then I would be anxious about the ‚Äúresponsibilities‚Äù and having to actually hang out, so I ended up losing them all. Right now I have no one and I really regret it. But also depression makes socializing truly exhausting, as do many mental illnesses. It‚Äôs so isolating to be struggling with mental health and interacting with others when you feel terrible is like a performance, and that takes a lot of energy. I hope you have/find friends who will stick by you even if you don‚Äôt interact much.üíú",53,1613616540.0,t3_lma24m,False

lma24m,gnuobck,DragonEndormi,"YES! This really sums up how I feel. I‚Äôm more of an introvert, I struggle a lot with anxiety and depression, and I can quickly become extremely overwhelmed. However, at the same time, I love socializing with friends and having fun with others, whether it‚Äôs in person or via text/social media. 

BUT then after a little while, I start dreading each message I get from them and start replying more infrequently and trying to end the text conversation. Or if it‚Äôs in person, I find myself avoiding them or wanting to leave even though I love their company and we‚Äôre having a good time. Even a damn Zoom call feels like too much. 

Because of this, I end up being very inconsistent and end up being rather flaky. I tell someone I‚Äôd love to see a movie with them one day, and I go through with it and have an amazing time. Then I agree to go again the following week but then I back out at the last second cuz I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed and the thought of interacting with friends is too much. 

This is one thing I‚Äôm striving to work on by being upfront with people if it might be too much social interaction for me/feel overwhelming, and also trying to make plans that I can commit to and trying to get myself to go through with them.

Edit: Just adding here that I also find myself frequently in online communications with friends where I feel like I‚Äôm being too boring or too talkative or too much of a burden even though they haven‚Äôt indicated anything to me. For this, I just keep reminding myself that I have personally rarely (if at all) been in text conversations with friends where I was like ‚Äúugh this person is so annoying‚Äù so it‚Äôs highly unlikely that they actually think that of me and that it‚Äôs just my anxiety trying to convince me that I am a terrible friend/person.",5,1613622959.0,t3_lma24m,False

The reason I had this ‚Äúdon‚Äôt make friends‚Äù rule was because I didn‚Äôt want anyone to notice the symptoms of my mental disorders. Friends notice, acquaintances don‚Äôt.

Besides, how on earth would I bring MDMA to a hospital and then decide to take it?' 

I was being honest, they didn't re-test me, the policy is to discharge anyone who's violated the rules of the hospital (and, well, general laws, MDMA here is illegal) but they didn't do that either. They said they'll do another test, but didn't.

By using each iterations as learning lessons, it‚Äôs gotten better. Ya, it sucks having to fight to function, but you gotta deal with the cards you were dealt. 

My last observation is how I would cope is very important. I always try to think of better, healthier ways to cope while I‚Äôm up and productive so when I am down, I have some tools at my disposal.

junrt7,gcf7zo5,kittykathazzard,"Thank you for posting this! I was assaulted by my Uncle as a young girl, gang raped at age 15 at my older brothers home (not by him or his friends, thankfully) however, when he came home and found me he was more upset about how his future ex-wife was going to react and told me not to tell our parents. 

Then due to the traumas I had experienced I took to drinking, a lot, and when I was 19 I was out at the local pub and was smashed beyond the extremes, a old school friend asked me if I wanted to go to an after hours party. I trusted when I should not have and was raped by multiple men that night. 

I was young, embarrassed and at that time thought it was my fault and did not report it. I lived with the shame of all of it, the anger, the rage, and it turned into depression, anxiety, C-PTSD. I also became an alcoholic. My life spiraled out of control. 

I did try to escape by joining the USAF, and I left the day after graduation, but my body rejected me, that is how I saw it, when I was released due to a previous medical condition, though they had not found it on all the physicals before hand. While in the AF I married my first husband. We were divorced one year, one month and one day after we got married. That did not help my mental status.

I was in 2 more abusive relationships, the last leading up to where I had to leave basically in the dark with only a few hours so I could get out before he came home, or I would not be typing this today. I moved from the Midwest to halfway across the country. I did not know I was pregnant at the time. That pregnancy is what made me walk away from alcohol. I stopped instantly and have not had a drink in over 22 years. 

I have went to therapy ever since I met my current husband. He has helped me with the walls I have put up around me to protect myself. He understands that I am still jumpy at loud noises, closed spaces, and do not let anyone put their hands around my neck. He also knows my long term memory is like a sieve, there are holes there that I don‚Äôt know if I want filled in or not. Sometimes memories come rushing back and when they do, they usually are not pleasant.

I deal with night terrors, insomnia, migraines, panic/anxiety disorder, C-PTSD, Depression, long and short term memory problems and then on top of it I do have quite a few chronic health issues. However, with therapy I have learned to deal with panic and anxiety attacks by grounding myself, the depression is always a work in progression. There are a lot of good days rather than bad days now, and that helps. When I am having a blue day, I have learned techniques to help me to TRY to uplift my mood, it doesn‚Äôt always work. C-PTSD, I ...shit kids, I don‚Äôt know what to tell you, time it takes time, talking to people, anybody who will listen. I know that has helped me. 

So yes, it does get better. How long? It depends on if you get help, if you use the tips and techniques you are taught, what kind of trauma and how much trauma you experienced, how much of a support system you have, and if you out in the work. But trust me, you will feel better if you do.

I didn‚Äôt know there was special trauma therapy until I read it in here, I need to speak to my therapist about that, that might be the trick! 

I rambled and I apologize, I guess I was sharing my story in hopes someone would listen.

hdcopp,fvkqan1,HafFrecki,"Hey, is tinitus the cause of your troubles?

I've suffered from chronic bilateral tinitus since I was 4 years old. I'm 47 now. I was kicked in the head by a wild horse just before my 4th birthday which is what caused it. The docs think it's caused by problems with blood flow in my skull as a result. I didn't make great choices later in life that really helped either.  Military service with lots of guns and explosions, rock shows etc. I still shoot as well, but I'm very careful about ear protection since my late 20's.

But let me give you some advice from a fellow sufferer.

Tinitus is always worse when you're fatigued. After a long day of work when I sit down in the evening I'm practically deaf and the ringing in my ears is physically painful.  So I read, or listen to whatever music I'm in the mood for to distract me from it.  I've had a hell of a week myself and was presenting at a virtual conference yesterday as well so I'm way more fatigued than usual and today it's really bad. So I've rested, listened to some Spanish dance music and danced in the day. Now listening to some punk core and still rocking out. These things work for me, you'll find what works for you. Swimming is good too. Something about the extra pressure when you go underwater really relieves the noise for me.

You get used to it, learn to manage yourself and it's fine. You have a physical disability for which doctors don't know for sure what causes it and can't cure it. All my friends know that if there is background noise I probably can't hear them and they're great at including me in conversations when were in bars or wherever.  Tell people about how they can help.  Let them understand your disability and you might find life is tolerable after all.",26,1592775044.0,t3_hdcopp,False

There‚Äôs a user telling people to kill themselves on this and other mental health subs, also commenting that people are faking illnesses etc.

tqk4gp,i2ig3ik,Quinlov,"The trauma response thing is something that I feel is a problem in even relatively respectable sources and possibly even on some level within the scientific community. 

So many disorders have trauma in their aetiology. The following groups of disorders are generally acknowledged to have a direct relationship with trauma:

Trauma- and stressor-related disorders (obviously)

Dissociative disorders

Personality disorders

Psychotic disorders

Addictions

Eating disorders
 
Obsessive compulsive-related disorders 
 
Somatoform disorders 

That is already a massive proportion of all the mental disorders. Then we remember that BPD, a disorder which has one of the tightest links to trauma (people with BPD are 13 times more likely to report childhood trauma compared to controls), like all the personality disorders (although I believe BPD is worse than the other PDs for this) has a habit of continuously spawning Axis I disorders, particularly mood and anxiety disorders, addictions (again) and eating disorders (again). And as if two shots at an addiction or eating disorder wasn't enough, most people with BPD also have...another personality disorder, and everything that entails.

By this point we've easily covered most of the mental disorders that exist, especially when you take into account the overall prevalence.

The only ones that either do not seem to have particularly close links to trauma, or whose association with trauma I've simply forgotten about (sorry!) are some of the more obscure ones like non-24.

So basically... Trauma can have a wide range of effects on the mind and brain, and seems to be one of the most globally devastating things for an individual's mental health, which isn't exactly surprising. Therefore saying that X mental disorder is a trauma response is pretty useless and also inaccurate - while most mental disorders are linked to trauma, labelling a disorder as a trauma response completely ignores the people with that disorder who have not experienced trauma.",11,1648518094.0,t3_tqk4gp,False

First of all well done for holding on and for finding something to keep you going- its unbearable to feel suicidal, and the relief that you will get from having this friendship is a million times worth the pain and suffering that you have gone through. You are such a strong person and deserve all the happiness in the world.

Secondly, isn't it wonderful that there is someone out there who loves you so much that you would live for them? Not only does it force you to keep on going, but it shows that you are worth the life you have, and gives you a reason to live for.

1744b37,k4863vp,Bellaprincipessa1974,"OP please know I understand and you are not alone. This is so wrong of your mother...so abusive. I'm just so sorry. As a woman(now 49)who went through the same thing as you for like 13 years, you didn't deserve any of that. I was traumatized. I used to dry heave and throw up in my mouth and feel such panic(til I got into therapy in my early teens)at the sound of my mother or her voice causing the memory of a particular ""sound"" my mother made during her sexual escapades, all while purposely making sure she was heard even after I was in my own bedroom and out of hers because it literally caused me to involuntarily react in fear and have the above physical reactions. She finally gave me ear plugs at 10 or 11years old(which was another self centered and psychotic move on her part)and would make me the butt of her disgusting humor and jokes during her drinking sessions every weekend with her and her ""partners"" drinking buddies...she thought it was hilarious that she traumatized me(her exact words every time she had a chance to bring it up).

My mother was/is an evil witch and is as self centered and narcissistic as an abusive mother can be. And, of course, my mother thinks she did nothing wrong in her mind and in her warped outlook. Your mom sounds very selfish and abusive. You deserved none of her shit and none of her abuse, because believe me friend, it was/is abuse. You are super brave sharing with this community! I am so proud of you and I thank you.

I am now a very happily married woman to my first love for over 30years with 3 adult children who were and are my world and 4 precious grandbabies that come in a close second to their parents. I could never do what my mother did or put our children through any of what I went through, or any abuse or evil. Our kids and I(and our kids and their Daddy)are so close and bonded as mother and child/children and as parents and children and I/we love and respect them so much, as they do me/us and we tell each other often through open communication and honesty on all sides. We have an open, non stop line of communication where they feel and know they are safe and loved. As children should feel and as they should be able to be trusting in their parents. We were blessed to be parents to our children and it's a privilege to be able to give them the best life, all the support and encouragement and all the love we possibly can while making sure their home and their Daddy and I are theirsafe place and they know we would never cause them any pain.

I worried as a teen, just like you are worrying, about my ideas around sex and thinking I was going to be messed up forever due to the trauma and warped ideas my mother brought me up with. But, it didn't ruin me or my adult life or my ability to be a loving wife and mother! My husband and I are so close, so deeply in love and we enjoy a fullfilling, beautiful and exciting sex life and we always have. I was able to be free sexually and totally safe with him thanks to the years of therapy I mentioned getting into in my teens. Try to get into a good therapist ok? I promise you will get through this and your thoughts about how much she damaged your sexual ideas will be a thing of the past. You will understand how a private and loving sex life between two people is a really amazing and beautiful act. You will be ok OP and thank you again so much for being brave and sharing on here...and one more time, I just have to tell you, I'm very proud of you! You are in my prayers always.üôè

PS...
I have not spoken to my mother in decades and not just due to the above, but her evil outlook on it being ok and how I should stop whining about her sex life bugging me as a kid and just so much more I won't get into on here. If you end up feeling safer and stronger and at peace without your mom in your life, that's absolutely ok. Or, if you work it out and she admits her abuse, asks your forgiveness, gets ALOT of professional help and is treating you right and respecting you as a mom should, that's great too, IF that's what YOU want and as long as it feels safe for YOU and YOUR future.

I'm only 18 and the only real reason I kept my baby is because I saw how happy the dad was when he found out. I know it's such an awful thing for me to say but it's honest.

My life now in comparison to before is vastly different. I used to go get drunk with my dad and listen to music, tattoo myself and just be an overall reckless teen but everything that happened during/after my pregnancy has changed me so much. I'm lucky if I leave the house more than 1-2 times every 1-2 months and just straight up don't have the energy to keep up relationships. The birth was very traumatic (was told me and my baby would die) and the dad just told me to get over it.

I probably went off on a bit of a tangent and I know our situations aren't exactly the same but as long as you know that other people are in this with you. Knowing other people are in similar situations to me makes me feel a little less alone. 

Personally I am trying to be the mum my baby deserves and now she's a 1 year old and is a lot more interactive it's a little easier.

806dfs,dutoywn,None,"This is awesome I do this mentally I think people should have like a unique one of these for themselves because everyone is different. Mine would be tweaked to add more diet and real physical stuff as that's how I tend to be. 

Having this online to in like a clickable format I think would certainly reduce people's symptoms especially if after every segment it reminds People to take a slow deep breath. 

For me here is mine:

How's your gut bacteria? eat some cold potatoes, oats,  kimchee, sauerkraut, garlic etc. 


Hydrated is a great one only I'd add. 
Have you been drinking too much alcohol? If so walk it all off and hydrate.

Tired? Sleep. 

Can't sleep? Watch TV have a snack, listen to some sleep music.

Not tired? Go for a walk or swim. 

Stressed by work/kids etc?  Go de-stress with a walk/beer/meditate/yoga/fishing etc. 

How's your vitamins and minerals and hormones? B vitamins, magnesium, fish oil, turmeric and vitamin d are crazy good for you take some. Get your hormones checked by a simple blood test. 

How's your diet? Eat something super healthy. Fruits veggies fish etc. How about a lean steak? 

Feeling emotional? Hug it out or talk it out. Got no one to talk to google it almost every country has  a free hotline with someone there waiting to talk to you.

Been outside lately for some sun or fresh air? Get your ass outside in the garden or go for a hike/walk/park.

Have a lot of thoughts making you feel all over the place? Write it all out. Seriously. This is very therapeutic. Not the writing type? Use voice recorder. Get it all out you'll feel much better. In fact try to do it daily. 

Angry? Go to the gym, hit the bag, chop wood, do push ups, go for a run. If that helps join a class like boxing, or bjj.

Feeling overwhelmed in general? Step outside,  focus your attention on something else a video game,  write a letter or email, plan something, take a cold shower. Moving your mind when you begin to panic and focusing on something else will almost always do the trick. 

Panicking now? Slow breathes through your nose only. In and out of your nose only. No deep breaths it's just a panic attack it'll go away on its own. Your not going to die your not having a heart attack. Control your breathing and control your thoughts. Once your breathing is controlled think about something else. Something specific. What's your mums maiden name? Why do they always ask that? What would it be like to be driving a car right now in the outback desert of Australia? Have you ever tasted Chili chocolate? 

 I also like to keep Valium on hand I don't always have it but there's nothing wrong with having it as a back up at all IMHO. If you've never had it, it does work, it does calm you down and can even put you to sleep if your in a bad spot but also mentally it's a good back up. Go and speak to your Dr. 

Finally if your not seeing a psychologist you should. A lot of people see counsellors or therapists which is good but if you can see an actual psychologist that's even better but start off by seeing your doc. 

Finally you're not crazy. 

Being anxious, depressed or whatever it is is just part of the human condition depending on what's happened to you during your life. You'll be OK you just need to cross off some of those boxes. All people can get better it's just a matter of the right combination of therapy for some people it's as simple as nutrition or hormones for others it's the relationships or work they have for others it's a chemical drug they need and once their on it they are perfectly fine for some it's regular therapy and for others it's exercise and hormones and some times its all of the above. 

Start off with a checklist like this and see your doc the earlier you do the better it is. 

Don't believe me?

Google examples of people who got better after XYZ.  there are thousands.

Your brilliant and beautiful you'll be fine.

That being said: I would be wary of keeping a mindset that prioritizes ‚Äústreaks‚Äù rather than a mindset that prioritizes your overall well-being.

I can‚Äôt tell you how long it‚Äôs been since I‚Äôve self harmed, but I can tell you that the last couple months have been happier than the ones before that, and my compulsions to self harm have decreased significantly, and the times when I did have a meltdown that resulted in me hurting myself required MUCH less recovery time for me to bounce back to feeling okay, because when it DID happen, I wasn‚Äôt focused on ‚Äústarting over‚Äù or feeling bad about it happening.

Honestly regret it, they fucked me up pretty good in hindsight. 

I‚Äôve had therapy and shit since, this was a long time ago, but I remember they did change my perception of human life. Curiosity does kill the cat.

I think saying they ‚Äúdesensitized‚Äù me is too simple an answer for some pretty complicated consequences but it just made me realize the fragility of the human body. The line between a person and a substance resembling tomato paste is a very fine line indeed. 

The world can be a dark and shitty place, and there are people living on it that can truly commit some
heinous acts. The key is to not think about that. Focus on YOU being a good person, YOU making the right choices. 
With common sense and a good heart you will never experience the things in those video, and will never be the person carrying out those acts.

‚ÄúGore‚Äù in itself just refers to the destruction of the human body. We‚Äôre all just walking, intact sacs of ‚Äúgore‚Äù. A compound fracture during an innocent basketball game is ‚Äúgore‚Äù and a man having his face peeled off is ‚Äúgore‚Äù. Just don‚Äôt think about it, keep yourself busy, tunnel vision is the key.

You could try focusing on something else, like watching a comedy or rewatching an old show which makes you nostalgic.

You could even try simple trauma EMDR therapy by playing Tetris (studies show that playing Tetris after a traumatic event can prevent you from developing trauma disorders like PTSD. 

And finally, you can do what I‚Äôve done, accept what you‚Äôve seen. Truthfully, you already likely knew that these horrible things happened in the world, likely all the time. You already know laws are in place to prevent it, organizations exist to fight it, and every day people all over the world are working together to try and stop these violent, cruel acts from happening. You knew these things happened, now and in history. Accept that it has happened. Accept that your feelings about that will be hurtful, and that being reminded of what you saw will be hurtful. You are human, of course you are upset. You cannot make yourself not care when you see cruelty. Accepting it is not ignoring it, accepting it is allowing yourself to see the reality of the world you live in. It likely means changing some things about your life. Maybe you‚Äôd like to do some research about how to prevent that from happening, like how to spot victims of sex trafficking. Maybe you‚Äôd like to let your friends and family know the risks that exist in the world and how to protect themselves. Maybe you‚Äôll pay more attention to the vulnerable people you see in public now. Maybe you‚Äôll pay more attention to the news coming out about that country where these things are more common.

Advice you never asked for:

Since I have 0 relationship with my parents, I think of myself as my own parent. They never took care of me anyways, and although it's not the same, practicing being a parent on your own self will help you in the future too in case you decide to have kids or work with kids, or even have a partner! 

Perhaps the best gift you could give yourself might be that - that's what I did for myself years ago. You won't feel so lonely (or if at all), your confidence will grow, you'll become stronger in a way. Look at yourself in the mirror and tell yourself (or perhaps read this lol it's long): 

""Look at you! You have grown so well. You look amazing. You're alive xx years already! So strong! Listen honey, this year - let's take a few more steps. Slowly but surely. Have you decided who you want to become this year? Let me remind you some basic rules before we continue with this year: 

1. If you want someone's attention and they're not giving any to you or call you attention seeker - know that asking for attention means you are looking for love. Meaning to say if they don't want to give you love, you don't need that person in your life. You choose your family(!). Stay away from those people and choose new ones. I promise you'll forget about them once you find people who do care. You might still be sad and disappointed, but after enough time, you will be very happy and proud of yourself for choosing not to need those people anymore. You'll see!

2. Never ever ever - talk bad about yourself or to yourself. Admitting mistakes is one thing, but calling yourself dumb or stupid or slow - no no. Instead, choose to think encouragingly: ""Okay, I made a mistake. I now know better for the next time./I am/was overwhelmed/anxious. I will take a break before I continue."" You learn by being exposed to things. Nobody has the right to make fun of me for not knowing something, even if it's a basic or intuitive thing. It's okay to not know something - you can always learn. Some things might simply go slower for you, even learning slower. That doesn't mean there are no things you excel at or that you're good for nothing. You're lovable! You might find it hard to believe, but people will love you even if you have nothing to offer. My purpose is to enjoy this life and that's it. That's all I am. And I am really happy with it. Me being myself is what makes me lovable. It's what makes you lovable. Confidence up!

3. Practice self-care as much as you can,,, Drink enough water. Everyday.""

&#x200B;

That should be about it. I know it's advice you never asked for, but you can't make a person care or make them feel things for/at you. It'll only hurt you to need that though (first hand experience), so once you can, once you feel brave enough or strong enough, choose to not need them. Shifts in mindset help a lot. It takes time, and doesn't seem true until it happens.

I promise you you will get better.

(Also you can literally look for TikTok parents and maybe find someone who is in your area to be your new parent. Honestly. I like that for myself. Maybe you can contact someone to be there for you, at least to celebrate your birthday.)",9,1607976426.0,t3_kcwpp4,False

I haven't talked to pretty much any of my friends for over a month. The more I put off talking to them, the more this anxiety builds up of will they be mad at me the next time I text them. Dealing with arguments, especially in this state, is horrendously mentally draining. So I keep putting it off to avoid this, even though I know that'll only make things worse.

My therapist told me the best thing to do was send a short message to each of them explaining that I'll talk to them at another time when I'm feeling less down, and for them to have patience with me. And if they don't understand, then they're not worth being friends with. In all honesty, I know there's a bigger chance of my closer friends accepting this rather than not, but it's the fear of uncertainty of what they'll say that stops me from talking. Or just the mentally draining part of holding a conversation.

I'd try reaching out to them when you feel ready to, even if it's just a quick message. As for your boyfriend, talk to him about how you're feeling. Him and your friends are there for you to talk about these things, even if it may seem like an extra inconvenience for them, it's not. And if they decide that they don't want to help you because of this, they're not worth it.

erbb2h,ff2v7wd,shippingprincess13,"I live in the U.K. and have depression, anxiety, psychosis and dissociative identity disorder. I was in and out of therapy throughout the entirety of my childhood because of trauma. It was no help what so ever. 
I didn‚Äôt get diagnosed with did and psychosis until I was 18 and transferred to the adult services after my mother made it very clear that my brain wasn‚Äôt going to fix itself just because I turned 18 (yes, they DID actually try to suggest that). 
I got with my fianc√© around the time I got diagnosed with did and psychosis, and he has always been amazing. My alters feel comfortable enough to come out with him, he tells me when things are real or not real when he somehow notices that I can hear/ see something. He makes sure my ‚Äòpanic space‚Äô is clear as soon as possible, despite it also being the place I usually just dump my stuff when I‚Äôm in a rush. He‚Äôs my saving grace. 
We tried to get therapy because I‚Äôm finally ready to talk about childhood trauma but ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have anyone who specialises in that here‚Äù. We went everywhere. We tried the NHS, we tried Uni. We‚Äôre students so it‚Äôs not like we can afford private healthcare but we‚Äôre trying to save up whatever money we can for some private therapy sessions with either a trauma or did specialist. 

But my fianc√© is my everything. He is the one thing that keeps me sane. I also write (starting a professional blog soon too!) and spend a significant amount of my time gaming. It helps me not be so angry. It‚Äôs stopped me hurting myself a few times. I‚Äôm /lucky/ to have DID because my alters are my best friends. They know when I need a break and help me. 

I also have this one lecturer that doesn‚Äôt actually teach me this year but she‚Äôs amazing. Each week she emails me for a check in. Whenever I need it, we meet in the university coffee shop and she gets us drinks (she knows we‚Äôre saving for therapy and a wedding and countless other things so each time we meet, she offers to buy me some drinks and sneaks in a slice of cake for my fianc√© too- literally the sweetest woman ever) and we just chat. Sometimes it‚Äôs about my personal life. A lot of the time it‚Äôs a mix between my personal life and uni work, in which case she helps me in whatever way she can with uni work, whilst chatting about my personal issues. She reminds me when I need to pick up medication (when I started uni, I wasn‚Äôt on any so she was worried about me. She just memorised when I need to pick up my meds now) and if there‚Äôs any uni workshops that she thinks I‚Äôll benefit from, she emails me before the general email comes on to tell me that there‚Äôs one day with a smaller class etc so I don‚Äôt have to panic. Heck, she found me crying in the library the other day whilst I was finding books for an assignment. Why was I crying? I was listening to Hamilton and the world was wide enough came on. What did she do? Made me a cup of tea and let me talk about Hamilton for over an hour whilst ordering the books I need to be taken to the front desk for me to pick up. I‚Äôm studying history so it‚Äôs a tiny bit relevant, but not really. I think I spent a full half an hour going on about how in Burn, Eliza sings ‚Äúlet future historians wonder how Eliza reacted when you broke her heart‚Äù and how it‚Äôs so cool and it might be an acknowledgement of how historians haven‚Äôt found out a lot about Eliza, despite her coming from a wealthy family and marrying someone who would become a founding father.

I had no friends, no support system and was very isolated from other people my age. I felt so out of touch with real life. Had no faith I'd ever achieve any of my dreams or actually get to enjoy life.

But then I heard about a mental health youth organization that's active where I live. It's made of other people who either work in the mental health field, have personal experiences with mental health struggles or have close ones struggling. I'm 21 now and have been a member for 3 years. It was truly my saving grace. It is the most open-minded, supportive and accepting group of people I've ever met and since I don't have don't have any close family, they've become one for me now. 

Within the organization I can be as active as I want, there is no pressure to ever do something or go somewhere that I don't feel comfortable with. But I can also do everything and anything I'm ready to do. I finished two 2-day courses - one that gave me the skillset to go to schools and do workshops about mental health, the most common illnesses, how to notice them and support yourself and others and where to find help; second one that taught me how to shape my personal story into something inspiring, which is now something I share as a part of the 1,5h workshop. I am completely open about my struggles which has led quite a few struggling teens to me asking for advice or help. 

I am also a part of a circle within our group that is pushing for proper mental health policies in our country and have even gone to a meeting in the Ministry of Social Affairs to stand up for the voice of youth struggling with mental health. It feels like I've achieved full circle.

Connecting with teenagers and young people has now become one of my favourite things. I'm even considering to become a youth worker or something similar in that area. Never in my life would've I guessed that I'd be interested in that.

I still struggle daily with many mental health issues and top of that I'm now also in a severe state of grief. But I am accepted the way I am and the way I'm feeling. And all of that - the sense of community, being able to help and inspire others and having constantly something to plan for, either an acitivity, a workshop or a meeting, has truly given me a sense of purpose.

The best way to combat this is to try and be the change yourself. I am one of the people that i described above, i have a well above average IQ, and also have been clinically diagnosed with depression. I still struggle with the feeling of helplessness- because I have noticed one overwhelmingly accurate cycle in life- People always do whats best for themselves. For example, if you date someone and they leave you, it all boils down to one factor- they thought they were doing whats best for themselves. This mentality is not flawed- its our basic instincts. The problem with it is that there will never be a ""greater purpose"" if people only lookout for themselves.  I have started trying to break this cycle myself, and it genuinely helps my depression. For example- if I see someone broken down on the side of the road, I stop and help. This isnt whats best for me, its whats ""best"" for the stranger. It brings me joy to try and break the cycle.

I actually was happy for a time. Then I started to recall all this crap and how much I actually knew. I was incredibly smart and now I'm more so hollowed out and dumber. 

Yay but I lived! No. I don't really care I lived. In fact I'm absolutely livid with the fact they saved my life. No one had a say except my surgeons. They elected to save me.

Now deep in bills, I forgot how to do my job, I pay for pills for life, and I can't walk correctly. Yay but they saved me? 

I hate it. Truly i would be fine with death because life is pointless. 

How do I find meaning to go on? I don't fear death in any way. I go on for others. I find purpose in people I love. I live with my gf and I love her. I believe that I came back to this shitty world just for her. We aren't married due to my ability to accumulate massive debts due to my depression and handling of money. Personally I would never like to see anyone I loved dead. But would it be painful to hear they died? No I'd be sad for weeks but I wouldn't be gone. Life is death to me. I believe when we die we go on. Not like religiously but just we go on. So it's not an end but just a new beginning and so I find comfort knowing that they just forget me and go on to something new. Possibly also a pointless existence. 

You must find meaning in going on. Either through someone or your self. So I believe I can pass my knowledge to a child and they will go on with it. I will protect that child to the extent I can. Therefore my purpose is served.

I found purpose in others. I find life rather mundane. But I also find many people rather simple and perhaps eugenics wouldn't be terrible. But I believe in choice more than that so I'd never condone eugenics. Just a lot of folks are stupid and it doesn't help me believe life is any more worth it.

Also I have issues with religion. I've basically been dead 3 different times and no there were no angels, devils, or a god. It was strange but never a religious strange. So religion to me is pointless. I believe it's giving in to a strength unseen because you cannot produce the strength you need to go on.

But basically life is purely pointless. We find meaning in each other and we develop strengths to endure it.

I'm not saying no one should use Tiktok or Instagram or quit all social media.

dwmnok,f7k9iem,WalnutBirdcage3,"Get a therapist, sounds like trauma. Someone to help guide you through managing the symptoms would be ideal.

Read into DPDR and how stress causes it, that's what the ""not real"" and ""foggy"" symptoms are. There's a survival mechanism in the brain of sorts that makes you disassociate under stress (car crashes, etc), but it can be stuck ""on"" for long periods of time. There's ways to manage it, and eventually you can get those symptoms under control. I have some experience with DPDR, you might want to look into strategies for staying grounded.

It's common to feel unsafe around things you associate with an extremely stressful situation. Getting around or managing that is going to require a trained therapist.

dwmnok,f7kg2tn,iostefini,"It takes time to recover from traumatic events. It's normal to still be shaken after something like that. 

One of my friends saw someone get stabbed once. For the next two days, she kept shaking and thinking over the event again. On the second day, she talked to another friend who had seen something similar in the past, and they shared how they felt and their experiences. I think it helped her a lot, because she stopped shaking so much and she even laughed once, which was soooo nice to see. 

After about a week, she seemed back to normal, though I'm sure mentally it took longer for her to feel completely fine again. 

Your school will bring in counselors to talk to students. Talk to the counselors, and that will help. Apart from that, all you can do is be nice to yourself and do things that make you feel safe and relaxed (for example, take a bath, fluffy blankets, scents of things you like, walks in peaceful places, hobbies, hanging out with people you care about..). It's normal to have a lot of strong emotions (or numbness) when something like this happens, so let yourself feel however you're feeling. 

Don't think about going back to school just yet. Give yourself at LEAST a day to recover. Once you've taken that time to recover, you can think about school again. 

If you don't feel any better after two weeks, it might be a good idea to get more professional help. (It's ok if you're not fully recovered by then, but you should at least be making progress.)

d01gdo,ez5v070,olivish,"Yes I get this so often I've thought of making my own post about it. I'm introverted and socially anxious, so I've never done well at social gatherings. Recently, though, my depression has been getting better so I've been able to enjoy my time with family/ friends. I look forward to social gatherings (even while I'm a bit anxious), I have a good time during the events, and I am even sad when they're over, even though I simultaneously look forward to getting back to my routine and reclaiming my space/ quiet time. 

So it's baffling to me that, even if I have a good time, I get this ""crash"" afterwards, which can last several days. I'm tired and *much* sadder than normal. I have trouble focusing, I have trouble maintaining my routines. I'm just *off.* But predictably, after a few days it lifts and I'm back to baseline.  

Here's my working theory - it's a combination of: 

- Alcohol/ dehydration (although I still get the crash even if I haven't had any alcohol at all... but surely, it doesn't help when I do drink it)

- Didn't get alot of sleep 

- Ate foods I normally wouldn't

- Skipped parts of my wellness routines to socialize (missed the gym/ missed mealprep)

- Social anxiety still not gone so I spend time over-analyzing everything I said and if I sounded stupid/ made an idiot of myself

- Comparing myself unfavorably to others I socialized with (this has gotten much better in recent years but I'm still not free of this) 

- Natural introversion causing mental and emotional fatigue from social interaction 

- Neurological whiplash, the brain overcompensating on a chemical/ physiological level from what it perceives to be over-stimulation. (No idea if this is backed up by research.)

So basically I think it's a bunch of things all hitting me at once, rather than just one thing. Which in a way is good, it means I can try and mitigate the effect with various strategies instead of just one. Like, skip the alcohol, skip excess treats, drink lots of water, plan around the social outing so it doesn't disrupt my normal routine too much, do some extra meditation, do some cbt work to rationally counteract the negative comparisons I make to other people... etc etc. 

Of course it's hard to do all that stuff when I feel like I've been hit by a depression bus. So I guess I also have to give myself a break and just let the bad mood *happen* to a certain extent, and know that it will pass... 

Still sucks, though. Because I find myself being choosy about social engagements, esp family gatherings, because I know how much it will ""cost"" me afterwards, and I'm sure it comes off to some people as a snub.",26,1567705559.0,t3_d01gdo,False

First of all, your potentials are not lost due to mental illness, it's simply not reasonable to expect you will constantly be getting ahead your entire life, there will always be something that can put you on the sidelines whether it's depression, disability, or any number of reasons. 

I got off all my pills that put me on since I was 8. 20 years of pill usuage the withdrawals, anxiety and depression completely wrecked me. I couldn't even move the first 6 months, could no longer drive a car even and very suicidal. I had to move back in my moms and she basically had to care for me. I couldn't work, my gf left me...I had to start from the bottom again. Achievements for me during this time was walking around the block once a day. It was a huge set back but now I'm doing better than ever, I backbavked around the world solo, met my new gf in Europe and moved there and now I've rebuilt my career and everything. 

My point is, you might get kicked in the nuts by life and have to sit a few plays out, maybe for multiple years but it's not a permanent thing. It does you no good to focus on what could of been, now you have to potential to rebuild yourselves better than ever and now having suffered, probably most of you have much more compassion now.

But I can. And so can you. We don't have to die. There are options. There are means of support.

And writing can be a salvation. Even if you don't become famous, or even published. The hardest part, but also the part that can help save you, is just doing it.

There are no guarantees, no easy solutions, no absolutes. Depression can be so horribly lethal, but there is hope. Family, friends, therapy, medication, welfare programs, and more.

ld9sd7,gm500gm,brumble10,"My heart goes two ways here. 

I'm regularly where you're at and I frustrate against calls of ""stop being so negative,"" or ""you're doing this to yourself."" At some level, yeah I need people to call me out when I'm stuck in my ruts but part of what makes them difficult is I don't know and/or understand what to do differently. 

At the same time, especially for others who don't deal with depression like I do all they can do is point out my behavior. They literally have no idea what to change or how to adjust things because they've never had the problem to solve on their own. It would be similar (but definitely not the same) as me (a male-bodied person) telling a woman how to handle their menstrual cycle just because I notice their behavior has changed and they've confirmed they're on their period. I can recognize ""the issue"" but I also have literally no basis for providing solutions. 

For me, what has helped is taking those who care and making an informal agreement. They can't ""fix"" me, I have to change but they can help me ""fix"" myself. The conversation becomes less about directives and more about inquiry and empathy. ""Stop being so negative,"" becomes ""it sounds like you're only seeing this, are you struggling with that?"" But I had to literally teach my loved ones that behavior because it's new and unknown for them. 

I feel for you there. It breaks my heart knowing that those who live with mental health burdens like mine are anachronistically stuck in a time where mental health is still so marginalized and ignored.

This is my latest way of coping with it: I started to live in the moment. Even if I'm just in bed or playing video games and not actually doing anything so-called 'productive'. Basically I started to stop caring about the future that much - making plans, getting frustrated when they fail, setting new goals, giving up on them because I realized I don't really want it. So I just go along, I just try to really enjoy every little moment. This is a lot harder than it sounds, but it's been effective for me.

I realized we are just here for a very brief moment. Maybe there's no purpose to my being here. But hell, since I'm here, at least let me enjoy it. Just do what you like, or what you used to like (sometimes I'm so depressed I don't know what I want to do, so I'll just find something to keep busy and do it, and it works as at least it keeps my mind out of stupid, negative thoughts).

This time in our lives is pretty crazy, and meeting people can be almost impossible especially if you don‚Äôt use things like tinder or bumble. But just know that you‚Äôre not alone in feeling like this. I‚Äôve been dealing with these kinds of feelings since I got dumped back in september, and for a long time I thought I would just never find love. But as hard as it is, the simple truth is that if that‚Äôs not gonna happen right now, you need to learn how to love yourself. And I know that everyone says that and it can leave you feeling like you can‚Äôt do it, but it‚Äôs a learning process. You just gotta start respecting yourself and letting yourself feel proud for doing the smallest, most simple things that are good for you. Trust me, at first it may feel like you aren‚Äôt capable of loving yourself, because I felt that too. But with enough time, you can learn to do it. It‚Äôs not the same as the kind of love you feel like you want with someone else, it‚Äôs more the way that you would feel about a good friend or a family member that you care about. It‚Äôs just getting yourself to go for a walk or brush your teeth or eat something healthy just because you know that while it may be harder than not doing it, it will make you feel better. It may not make you feel better right away, but it will pay off. And let me just say, if you put in the work and really try to be good to yourself, it will change things. I‚Äôm not saying that learning to love yourself will get you the relationship you desire, but it may help you to see that that connection with a person isn‚Äôt the end all be all, and it won‚Äôt fix everything. I‚Äôm not saying that that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre expecting from it, and if I‚Äôm completely off base with this then I‚Äôm sorry, but I‚Äôve been in that position before where I was doing terribly mentally and emotionally, and I thought that having someone to actually love me and care about me would help, and it did, but not in the way I thought it would. And you may not believe it, but someday you will meet someone who will give you that kind of love, but if you don‚Äôt love yourself, or even feel like you are worthy of love, which is way easier said than done, you may miss out on the opportunity to have that. Sorry if this made no sense, I just wanted to share my experience with this kinda thing and see if that could help give you a different perspective.

Do that thing

Remember this:
Treat it like a muscle, the more you act on that moment
L, the more its longevity and efficiency will increase.

If it gives you a minute and you act on it, you will feel good,

&#x200B;

I look at my own life.  Before meds: good, after meds: pathetic.  The link is clear, even if I am putting two and two together and making five.

&#x200B;

Any food from a hospital, water from the water machine, could contain medication, in theory.  It's hard to see the bigger perspective that it almost certainly isn't, when you've seen the actual reality which is that nurses do sometimes put meds in stuff, that's just true I'm afraid.  And once bitten, twice shy so it's hard to trust food and water from staff and parents.  Nurses will give you extra meds because it makes their day easier.  I have researched this, it's called covert medication and it's just a fact of life for nursing staff.  Probably more frequently with the elderly but when you're in a psychotic episode, you don't check your charts and you can be written up for as required meds that they won't bother to tell you they've put in your drink.  Who would find out?  If I was a nurse, I would probably do this too.  You can buy mild antipsychotics from a pharmacy (e.g. Motilium) and you can certainly buy sleep aids, if you don't want to go down the official PRN route and put them in the patient's drinks.

&#x200B;

So with all this it's no surprise he doesn't trust food and drink, but he probably does enjoy food so keep trying.  Prepackaged stuff should be as tamper-proof as possible.  For example a bottle of Coke can be opened and closed without losing the fizz but the seal will be broken, so make sure the seal isn't broken.

&#x200B;

I'm trying to help you by saying these things.  I know you want him to take medication because it makes your life, as family, so much better but try to give him as much self-determination as possible, as much agency over his own life as possible.  Let him know that he can cut down meds gradually over time.

&#x200B;

The common thing to say is ""oh he/she'll be on meds for the rest of his/her life"" but as mentioned the meds are poison so this is unbearable for us to hear as a patient.  It's not necessarily true, and anyone who says it is going out on a limb.  It's not true because there are changes and advancements in medicine all the time.  At one point, people would have been in an asylum for the rest of their life.  So don't say it, press home the point that you hope he will be off meds one day.  Don't believe the meds are the only way.  He is worried that it is true, and if it is true then it gives him a choice between him being happy versus his family being happy and him being miserable.  This is a horrible choice to face which ultimately ends in going back to hospital because you can't martyr yourself forever.  So don't tell him he'll be on meds forever.  The truth is that he can cut down gradually over time and then we'll see what happens.",3,1622593956.0,t3_npyyju,False

Furthermore more there is a hormone that causes the body to lactate however it also causes crying, naturally this hormone is found in greater numbers in females. So my theory is is that there is a reverse of that hormone and it's found more in men, it could be testosterone, or something else. This makes sense evolutionary speaking aswell as it would not be very beneficial to start sobbing when you get attacked or insulted and those who did would not make it. I suffer, I suffer alot, emotionally abusive family, battling with depression, etc. And yet even though I was not raised in a 'men don't cry' manner and feel so much pain, I can't cry, even if I wanted to, I find it very hard to do so.

Every breath is unbearable,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to write letters to people I love, give my little brother some of my things, steal my dad‚Äôs gun, and I‚Äôm ending this tomorrow.‚Äù

Well now I'm an adult and barely handle it decent,, but now I'm afraid of myself. I don't set myself up for suicidal thoughts, I actively try to avoid the feeling, and when it comes up I say ""I'm not comfortable and I feel empty"" I stopped saying ""I wanna k*ll myself"" because it's not something I should want to put into the universe.

Her boyfriend is my bestfriend too, we actually all met in a partial hospitalization program..

This must‚Äôve felt like the final nail in the coffin, and I don‚Äôt blame you for feeling that way especially if you have already been battling suicidality for as long as you have. It‚Äôs kind of impossible even imagining there is a life worth living, we can all tell you this here, but it‚Äôs damn near impossible to believe.

Near death experiences are often inherently traumatic. The near death of a child is something I doubt many humans would be able to process quickly or easily. It's OK that you're having this reaction and it's a normal reaction to an abnormal and very frightening event.

One thing that can be helpful in the immediate aftermath of something that shakes up your nervous system like this is, as weird as this sounds, playing Tetris. I can dig up the research on it if you're interested, or you can give it a shot and see if it starts to help you feel a bit more centered again.

I don't want to act like I know you, or tell you how to feel. Because no matter what I tell you, only you can work on your own feelings. 

But I can say that I have been in that space where I feel like I'm inferior to the people around me. It's a blessing and a curse to be surrounded by people who are talented, hard working, and genuinely good. On the one hand it could be a source of motivation and inspiration, but if you start comparing yourself, you could easily fall into a trap of depression and demotivation, feeling that no matter what you do, you can never get to where those other people are, so why bother?

That's a lie. A lie we tell ourselves to try and get out of doing the work. And sitting through this disgusting period of discomfort and fear. We know we have so much potential that we're not using, but using it scares us. We're scared to live.

But we need to take deep breaths and remember that on the other side of this crippling fear is life. If we never get to where other people are - that's ok. But we can get ourselves to where WE need to be. Where WE have the potential to be. In a future that you feel worthy and validated by YOURSELF.

Please know youre not inherently worthless. Like I said, even you sharing these words have added value to this conversation and this feed. It took guts to write what you did. It takes guts to even go to therapy ( a lot of people hide and don't even seek help!) So be proud of your showing up and doing the work you need to do. And take it step by step.

I think what you did today was great. You overcame the lies your depression was trying to get you to believe. Your actions show that you value your word - your promises and your contributions to life. These mean something to you. I would encourage you to keep engaging yourself and making commitments here and there to people you care about, and to yourself. Create little milestones that you have to ""reach"" and reward yourselves when you get there. Keep yourself focussed on each step and focus on doing what you tell yourself you will do. I think if you keep at it eventually you may quiet down that voice which tells you you're worthless and you'll find along the way you've built yourself what looks like a worthy life.",7,1631726171.0,t3_poqbpn,False

You graduated high school when you thought you wouldn't, didn't have supportive parents, AND had severe depression. That is incredible. I'm not being hyperbolic. Some people have a hard enough time graduating without all of those extra hurdles. Be proud of that.

I felt like you for SO long. I graduated when I was 25ish and I felt like a failure, because my younger sister already had a good paying job post graduating. But we all deal with different stuff, and we all have different paths. It sounds to me like you're still dealing with a lot of extra stuff that a lot of people don't have to. It might take you years to realize that, but it's the truth.

Also, it sounds like you're still pretty young. I know, I know. I hate hearing this from people and hated hearing it - but it's honestly true. I'm almost 30 now, and realize all that time I spent worrying about not making it, being a failure, etc. etc. - while yeah those are valid feelings to have and should be explored - they weren't really based in any truth.

E.g. Last time I checked it was still less than half the US population that didn't have a college degree. So while statistics don't really help me personally with feelings, sometimes they do, and I thought I'd just share that to let you know it's just statistically not true that you're a failure. Even not having a degree doesn't make you a failure, IMO. Depends how you measure success I guess, but that's another conversation.

Is there any chance you can get to a counselor? I truly believe that's your best course of action right now if you're not already. Good ones can teach you necessary coping skills, help you find out what's important to you, and help you figure out what you want to do next. Does your school have an academic advisor you can go to? I'm sure they do, as well as a counseling center as well.

It'll be ok. You'll have to do some work, and honestly that might suck for some time, but in the end it'll be ok. I'm gonna shoot you a DM, feel free to respond or ignore, no pressure!

Edit: Some context, I dropped out of college when I was 19 cause I was dealing with depression, thought that that was it, then went back a year later and took what felt like FOREVER to get my degree (an additional 5 years on top of that first year).

When I finally got the courage to stand up and study what I wanted to, I got straight As and achieved many degrees. I never had to ""study"" psych because I find it extremely interesting and so I would read something and just remember it. I also read WAY more psych books than were required. 

Now I am an expert in psychology because it's not something I had to ""get grades in"" like some chump struggling to perform at something he's a prisoner of. I love the topic and it was never a struggle. 

I have played tons of video games, seen countless movies, and I have never struggled to learn about them and can remember how to play them or what I saw about the story. I know lots of things about hobbies I enjoy. That is the way school should be. 

You will get bad grades if you do not like the topic you are studying. 

If you don't like the topic you REALLY will not like working the rest of your life at it, trust me. I have been working in my field for 31 years.

Forced isolation is not the same as chosen, it somehow feels different. And I've had to stop my therapy sessions because the center closed indefinitely during this crisis, and it stopped right in the middle of me basically only coping session-to-session every week... I'm drawing, and it helps to zone my mind out, but then I put the pencil down and reality is around me and it's too much.

I was recently diagnosed with depression (and the anxiety that I knew I had) and my family cannot be less supportive. And now I'm stuck in a national lockdown with my SO who has aspergers, and therefore absolutely no regard or understanding for any of my emotions, nevermind my mental health struggles. (At least) 19 days of lockdown left, and the thought is too much to bear.

And now because of this stupid virus I had to go back to my old country and currently Im in the same place as my abuser (my mom), dont have a job, running out of savings and soon I wont be able to pay rent and bills for my home abroad, my Erasmus went to shit, and recently I got an email saying that my last year of my degree might be postponed for a year if this virus doesnt stop until August.

So two days ago I had a panic attack. That I havent had in two years now. And yesterday I wanted to kill myself because everything is too much for me.

Instead of focussing on relaxation, taking care of ourselves (diet,exercise, sleep), relationships (partner, friends, family) and giving meaning to our lives.

We as humans haven't changed much in the last 10s of thousands of years, but our lifestyle has. We're being chronically overwhelmed and our biological and psychological needs aren't met in todays lifestyle.

Mountain gorillas don't struggle with cooperate/compete because if you guess wrong once, you're dead, which minimizes your experience of mental illness.

Under the best of circumstances: We have very big brains that are very good at detecting danger, and they frequently see ego wounds as death threats. 

Under not so good circumstances: Human beings are misery machines who traumatize the hell out of each other. 

If we started from scratch, going back 20,000 years, we would make all the same discoveries, do all the same things and make all the same mistakes. Maybe religion would be different but, as surely as ants do it, we would build cities, because that is who we are.

s65s0t,ht1tsv2,zenniferlynn,"Reading this felt like looking in the mirror. I have been in the exact same situation. I can especially relate to ""feeling like you are wasting someone's time"". I have been to 3 different therapists, and I always have this underlying guilt that I am taking away from time when they could be helping someone whose problems are much more severe than mine. 

I lacked some of the common symptoms of depression including ones you mentioned. I managed to get out of bed every day (albeit later than usual). I managed to put on a happy face so that no one could see what I was feeling inside.

But I was in a low place. I would burst out into tears several times a day, usually I didn't even know why. I felt everything on an extreme level. There was even a time I considered driving myself to the hospital because I was crying so hard that I couldn't breathe. 

My current therapist suggested trying antidepressants. I worked with a doctor and found one that worked right for me. Now it feels like a light has been turned on. I had NO idea that how I was feeling was not normal. I feel like my baseline mood has shifted up a few steps, and I am generally happy day to day. My mind has cleared so that I am able to face my true problems with a more clear mind and rational perspective.

I've been like this for years. It got really bad about 6 or 7 years back, and I started using IV heroin, but eventually ended up in treatment. I got a therapist and a psychiatrist, went back to school, and started working in Healthcare.  Things got really good for a while, but since the pandemic hit, I've just felt numb. 

I'm totally detached from myself and everyone else. I desperately want human connection,  but I think people sense my depression and desperation, which makes them avoid me.

But it isn't all wrong in my opinion it may make it easier for people who struggle to open up because even tho it's glamourised it opens a dialogue and make people more accepting of it.

But I think you are really generalizing with this post mental illness super complex. What you said about music is wrong in my opinion because its so complex and everyone's experience is different. If music is something that helps you cope that great but if it doesn't that fine as well. If I have a major panic attack listen to classical music really helps me calm down. You shouldn't invalidate peoples coping skills just because it doesn't work for you. 

I also don't agree with your reading of addiction it's not a virus and you definitely can recover from it. I think reading or think of it as an incurable disease or virus keeps people sick and makes it harder to recover from it.

It's sets them up for failure why do you think aa/na only has a 5% success rate. I'm not saying that it's easy because it's not recovering from addiction is a battle.

l85br5,glbkvw6,DiscontentDonut,"TL;DR - Anxiety freaken sucks, especially dating. It's okay to say nevermind sometimes.

As someone with anxiety that ratcheted way up out of nowhere and hasn't gone away since, I totally get this. And it isn't even just a ""you will have a bad time"" thing, it is that you will have *wasted* your time because suddenly you are convinced that this person isn't right for you and you somehow just know that you will be disappointed before the date's end.

It isn't a job interview where you are nervous but have to do it. This is an interview for someone to come into your life and you're doing the interviewing, and suddenly you decided you don't need that position filled. You have been doing just fine without it. Getting by. And you would rather keep getting by than put yourself through something you don't want to do.

And it isn't like you will never go on a date, either. Nor are you saying that none of it was nerves. But this person is...no longer worth traipsing your anxiety to get to. You need to self-soothe and binge a show you have seen a million times. Something you know you will enjoy because the outcome never changes and you already know you like it.

One of my most sincere and longest relationships where I truly fell deeply in love, we never went on a date until we were already together. There is hope for people like us. It is out there. But maybe there is a reason you called off this date. Be kind to yourself and just let your brain rest. You had a gut feeling and acted on it. Who cares if it was right or wrong? I firmly believe the right person would understand. If you feel you have to play cover-up with your anxiety to make someone else feel better, that person probably isn't right for you anyway.

One thing I will say, is that with that right person, even before we were ever serious, I was able to tell him, ""My anxiety just slammed me out of nowhere tonight and I need to take time to stay inside and recover,"" and he would understand. Even if he was really disappointed and needed time to cool off because he had been looking forward to the date and now had to deal with this let down, he would still come back and I was able to quell my anxiety enough the next time to make it up to him.

Anxious people, we are slow relationship builders. We don't get that Hollywood first date jitters but excited to learn about the other person feeling. We get, ""...No. This is wrong. This is all wrong. Abort. Abort.""

You know what? It's okay. It is *okay*.

l85br5,glbo4b9,ThyriR,"I can totally relate. A lot of people don't understand how paralyzing anxiety can be.

l85br5,glc55sf,DragonEndormi,"OMG I was going to post a rant about the same thing yesterday, but ended up deleting it (cuz anxiety smh). Yesterday was Bell Let's Talk Day in Canada (a controversial mental health awareness initiative) which triggered my annoyance.

I've struggled with anxiety and depression for almost a decade now, and I cannot deal with the conflation between mental health and mental illness. We all have mental health just like physical health, but having a difficult day with one's mental health is NOT the same thing as having a mental illness! I don't get why people think that anxiety is just being nervous or depression is just being sad. My anxiety can take any ordinary non- or minimally-anxiety-inducing situation and make it 1000x worse with me doing irrational things, having panic attacks, and getting tf out of there for no reason at all.

For example:

Nervousness is ""I'm so nervous for my presentation today. I'm worried people will find it boring. I hope it goes well. Let me take a few deep breaths before I get ready for work.""

Anxiety is more like ""I just woke up and haven't even gotten out of bed and I don't know why but my heart is pounding so fast and so hard and I don't even know how tf I'm going to get up and get ready for work because I feel sick to my stomach and now I'm hyperventilating maybe today will be alright but no it won't be I have that presentation 3 weeks from now and I have to go grocery shopping this weekend and that meeting tomorrow and there's just too much I need to get done and it's just all overwhelming I don't think I can do anything of it and all I can do it sit still and hope that this feeling passes even though I feel like I'm going to die because I cannot move and I'm pretty sure I'm going to get fired today.""

I really hope that more people can speak out about mental ILLNESS and stop this conflation between negative mental health and mental illness, because mental health awareness is already there, but there's relatively little visibility and understanding of mental illness itself (esp. the less common and more stigmatized ones like psychotic disorders, personality disorders and dissociative disorders).",9,1611982636.0,t3_l85br5,False

Today he was sent to the hospital because he felt extremely sick, and described pretty much every single symptom of COVID.

They have him in isolation at the moment, but the anxiety is killing me.

It was supposed to be a week later that he would come home but it seems obvious that he should quarantine himself for a couple of weeks at least which makes me even more worried because I keep thinking where he would go, who would care for him etc.

k3qv1t,ge4qw4k,blacksteel15,"Man, I totally relate to this. I don't have any one traumatic moment or period I can point to in my life. I have amazing parents and had a wonderful childhood... but I also have a brain that doesn't produce the right levels of certain chemicals. I've spent a lot of time feeling like I didn't deserve to be depressed or anxious or need help because what the fuck did I have to be depressed or anxious about.

But one thing I've learned through a whole lot of reading and reflection and therapy is that that doesn't help anyone. The best analogy I've ever seen is that trauma and mental illness are like a wound and an infection. Sometimes someone can be pushed through a plate glass window and get cut dozens of times and it takes some time to heal but then they're fine. Other times someone can get a paper cut that barely breaks the skin, but when it gets infected it becomes life-threatening. The severity of the cut doesn't necessarily tell us anything about the severity of the infection. In much the same way, the severity of the trauma you experienced doesn't necessarily tell us anything about the severity of the impact of that trauma on your mental health. Your struggles are valid, and recognizing that doesn't diminish anyone else's. As my therapist likes to say, ""Don't compare yourself to other people. Compare yourself to who you were yesterday.""",88,1606724572.0,t3_k3qv1t,False
k3qv1t,ge4u7t2,WinterGlory,"You are gaslighting yourself into believing you have not suffered enough yet to deserve help, but its not true. I can tell just from your words that you are suffering right now. And that is reason enough to seek help if you want it to stop. We all have trauma. Even a super sheltered kid from rich parent will have events occur that will be traumatic to him. Even if to us it sounds ridiculous.

For instance, you know how in a lot of movies or tv shows they always portray a teen girl being told ""no"" or ""card refused"" and it's they act like its the end of the world? Well we laugh at that because ""lol, the rich idiot is getting hit by our reality"" and to us it feels great that someone we consider supperior to us (in term of wealth and possibly power) suffers just like we do. But to that rich and sheltered kid, it is actually quite traumatizing. Being told no for the first time in their life, the humiliation of the situation, and in the people make fun of them on top of everything. In the show, its meant to make us laugh, but truth is, that exact situation would be traumatic if it wasn't faked. To us, its litteraly funny, its nothing, they'll ""Get over it"" eventually, since we live in this reality everyday and we survive without trauma. But its not because we dont suffer from it, that someone else wont be hurt by it. And that applies to everything. I can see blood without gagging. A girl I knew from high school split her nail and it was bleeding a lot and she fainted. Am I allowed to say blood is nothing because I can look at it no problem and she is just stupid? Absolutely not. Her fear is real to her. 

We can't be immune to everything. There will always be this one thing we struggle with. Personnaly, I was, like you, verbally abused. In my case, it was my mom. She gaslit me, manipulated me, fed me lies that on their own traumatized me, and she would spend hours just yelling at me. Leaving my room only to come back to bring the subject back and yell at me some more.  Because of my trauma, I am vulnerable to loud noises and voices. If someone raises their voice, I freeze. Both physically and mentally. I simply can't function if someone is mad at me. That may seem ridiculous to you, but its my reality. And I have surrounded myself with good people who understands and adapted to me while I work on this problem. You dont have to loose a leg or be the sole survivor of a plane crash to qualify for trauma. Trauma is personnal, its different for every one. It affects each and everyone in different ways. 

You deserve help if your trauma is too much for you to bear alone. Whether your card was declined and your dad told you to get a job or your whole family was on a plane that crashed, if you feel sad and need help to get better, you deserve that help. Simple as that.",32,1606728041.0,t3_k3qv1t,False

k3qv1t,ge51u0x,DepressionsDildo,"BEEN HERE. Dont play the Pain Olympics. Your suffering affected you negatively. Just because others have been raped or beaten doesnt diminish your trauma, honey. It just doesnt.

Like, my trauma is Complex Trauma. Complex Trauma is a series of little t traumas (vs one Big T Trauma like rape or a car accident). Little t traumas are relationship stuff, divorce, whatever. It still can traumatize and affect you later in life. Dont deny it, that will just allow it to keep getting worse. Trauma means how you felt in that moment, how you percieved it.

Hello there and great job! I hope my way of dealing with lack of motivation is of any help to you :). I understand how you feel about taking care of yourself, i feel that way often. Sometimes it's best to pick your battles imo, last night i just could not bring myself to shower. So i compromised and washed my hair. I know it can be overwhelming, so on those days when you are not feeling it, something is better than nothing. Even if it is the most basic of things, it counts. Be proud. And I understand your emotional numbness as well. I have been dealing with it for my whole life, so know that you are not alone. Many times i have found myself feeling invigorated with life, and many more times have i found nothing but dread. The feelings pass, the more i worked on myself and the more i worked for a better future, i have found that the dread is less frequent and stays less. Hell, sometimes i even have control over it, and it passes much more quickly. Maybe you feel you have no control over your life? I feel that way too, a lot. I found that taking some kind of challenge, burden, responsibility, anything...helps a lot. Don't overdo it though, take on something you can handle. There is no shame in that, be humble with yourself and watch yourself grow. And, lastly, about your friends, you are a good friend. You would not feel guilty if you weren't. Don't pressure yourself. Just let them know that you are having a rough time right now and that their attention, love and care is appreciated. Let them know how you feel, same goes for your family. Thank you for the long read, i hope it was of use :). Stay safe and best wishes.

PS - Know that you are not alone, none of us are. These feeling will pass, it will get better, know that you have control over you actions and your own life.

Back in my early 20's I did something similar, where I forced myself to look in the mirror and give myself at least 2-3 genuine compliments a day. Then, throughout my day, I'd try to give 2-3 genuine compliments to strangers or people working places I went. I like your idea of internalizing them better lol.

It did work, though. My attitude shifted massively. I became a lot more outgoing, social, started partying a lot and inviting everyone to parties, etc. Pretty soon almost everyone in town knew me and my phone was constantly blowing up. (granted, I grew out of this after my 20's lol)

ks6ow3,gieo0ov,None,"**EDIT:** Looking at the comments, OPs 'friends' weren't even close to being friends. Fuck those guys. Leaving the rest of my comment unedited in case it helps someone who is struggling with the same issue with their actual friends.

I think it's perfectly reasonable for people to say *""look, I'm sorry. I love you but I don't have the strength to support you""*. I think it's ok for friends to drop out of contact because they are being affected by your actions/issues. Compassion fatigue is valid.

But it's also horrible when friends don't even *try* to work on that issue FIRST. If they really value you, they should be working on ways to stay in contact and to stay supportive while avoiding compassion fatigue. All relationships take work, including friendships. It sucks that so many people drop out when it gets to be too much, without even working on repairing the bond.

Some good ways to stay supportive without burning out include: helping your loved one to find other resources for support and expanding their support circle, setting boundaries, and helping your friend to work on their own coping mechanisms to take some of the strain off of you.

I'm sorry your friends didn't do this for you. Ugh, and the *""own up to my actions""* comment was fucking cruel. :(

I know this sounds terrible, but maybe you are better off without those people in your life right now. Especially the one that made that comment. It sounds like they lacked the capacity to be a good friend to you in the moment.

I've been the friend who couldn't cope. I wish I'd known what I do now about relationships and boundaries and all that shit. Maybe I could have been a better friend. I'd like to go back and do over the whole thing, but I can't. When my own mental health issues got out of control I made sure to keep a wide circle of support to avoid the same thing happening to me. I made fun of myself to make the issue less stressful for people around me.

While I can't give you much advice, here what I learned:

\- Reach out and stay connect to people, and join social events, if you are bored, want to rant, feel sad or whatever, you can always chat with me :)

\- Ditch your toxic friends, although it's good to stay connected, make sure that they support you, and remember you are NOT worthless nor a monster.

\- IF you seriously want to kill yourself, try not to guilt trip yourself by thinking how you're being selfish, as this can create more stress and anxiety. Instead, lie on the stone cold floor, and feel the floor, stare at the celling, listen to the sounds of the cars driving by and the people talking, but most importantly, feel how you are still alive, then think about your day, and think about the small things that made you happy today, for example, today I managed to fix my drawer.  (this is what I do if I have serious urges to masturbate, not sure if it works but its worth a try lol)

\- Try to keep yourself busy with activities you enjoy, it's even better if it's social activities. If you start feeling a little better, start exercising and maintain a healthy and balanced diet.

\-Try not to overthink about yourself or your appearance, I know the saying ""everyone is beautiful on the inside"" sounds like bullshit, but it is true, and to make you feel better, I'm short and my feet are so big that I somehow look like a male version of Kirby, I also may have erectile dysfunction :|

Overall remember, it's okay to feel depressed, angry, stressed or anxious, we are human beings after all, don't listen to people who gives negative comments about you, but most importantly, remember that you are worthy and you are a good person.

A few things I want to add if that‚Äôs okay!

I had a major suicide attempt in November of 2017. I had been sexually assaulted and had been dealing with depression and such for years and then a looming jury trial for the sexual assault. I drank and then impulsively did the deed (I‚Äôm not going to share here the method).

I was intubated for days. I had to relearn how to turn my head without falling, relearn how to stand without falling, relearn how to walk. My balance is still messed up to this day. It was not a fun process. I got pneumonia from being intubated. After I was medically cleared (after several days in the hospital), I was moved to a psych facility. It was there that I finally learned that I couldn‚Äôt drink anymore. 

I‚Äôm already impulsive but add in a few drinks and my self control is out the window. Also, for people suffering with mental illness, drinking is like Russian roulette. It‚Äôs a depressant and if you‚Äôre depressed, it‚Äôs only going to make you feel worse. I know this is common knowledge but I haven‚Äôt drank since my suicide attempt and it has helped so much.

Another thing I realized is that I didn‚Äôt want to be dead - I just wanted everything to stop. If I had succeeded, I wouldn‚Äôt be engaged to my best friend in the world right now, I wouldn‚Äôt be going back to school, etc. 

Please know that even if it doesn‚Äôt feel like it, people care. People want you to reach out. As OP said, the people you leave behind will forever wonder what they could have done. Every moment is temporary. You will NOT feel like this forever. Call someone, write, cry, scream. Reach out for help, even if it‚Äôs to a random stranger like me! You are a fellow soul wandering this earth and therefore, I love you. You are never alone.

I absolutely don't blame anyone for not wanting to talk with me about how I'm feeling because it's intense, it's a lot for me to deal with so I can understand why it's a lot for other people too.

When people ignore community guidelines etc, it means anything I do means fuck all. Suicidal people need help and support, but never at the expense of others.

Edit for those not getting it: suicidal people deserve all the support and lifelines they can get, but NEVER at the expense of others. I don't go talk to my depressed family members with my thoughts of suicide because that would be at the expense of their health and safety. There are so many lifelines whether that be specific chat rooms, specific reddit subs, call and text lines. Literally when I'm suicidal and google anything to do with suicide I don't end up on r/mentalhealth first. You're not an arsehole or a horrible person for posting on this sub about your suicidal intentions.

m75qwm,gr9d4ie,Vatinas,"Yeah, I never understood that concept to be honest. My parents never went on with the threat part, but they did tell me to stop crying now and then, and I just couldn't understand that. I answered ""Alright, let me press my 'stop crying button' then"" once (which, obviously, didn't end well :P), and I feel like that sums it up well; what the hell is the child supposed to do?

Crying is the last resort of someone overwhelmed with emotion. When they reach a stage where they lose every bit of control over their feelings. How the hell are they supposed to ""stop"" that? It's like asking a barrelling car to stop barrelling and drive straight, or an overflowing pot of milk to settle down...

But to come back to the effect on a child, yeah, I totally agree that it's part of a parent's role (and responsibility) to teach their child how to understand and, then, handle their emotions.

kuvptu,giur5ry,Alteregokai,"Hey OP, I'd like to start out by saying that I'm agnostic too, and I guess I'm still exploring my spirituality. My family is a mixture of Catholics and Born again Christians. Being raised in a Catholic household, we would do the rosary as a family every death anniversary, make tons of food and lay the food and drinks out in front of our shrine, the photos of my family members who've passed and candles. I never was big on the rosary, however it still feels like I'm honouring their spirit wherever they may be (I believe in reincarnation) and connecting with them. The food however, was never a Catholic tradition, it's something that was passed on through my Filipino customs, we will take whatever we have made and leave it out for the Spirits of nature, ancestors and others to eat. 

This act is logically, to make us feel better and to make us feel like they're still there, enjoying food/drinks with us. But I can't help but feel a very strong connection to my dead relatives when we do this. I remember sitting in front of my grandfather's picture at my family shrine, and talking to him. I asked if he was done and I could eat his food now, the candle that was lit flickered and blew out, so I took that as a yes. 

I don't exactly think of it the way you do, rather the spirits come when they're called upon and given an offering, they visit, then they dip. But that's just my opinion.",3,1610351126.0,t3_kuvptu,False

My mom would specifically make an effort on birthdays/days of passing, but sometimes during memorable days or holidays as well and she would get upset if she forgot and even go so far as to just catch up and do it the next day.

To me it feels very comforting to do it, even though I for example did not know my grandparents for whom the plate was.

I like to read mangas. There are a few which the characters died and some of those say somewhere along the lines,
""it is the duty of the living to honour the dead""
""The dead remain in this world as memories for their loved/close ones. If there's nobody alive to remember them, that's when they no longer exist""

My 1yr 9mos daughter died in Jan 2016. A month after, my wife hospitalized and it goes downhill from there.
It was sadness that turns depression. Stress and depression that manifested physically into her brain.
Seizures and all. Hospital back and forth. 
She passed away last June 2019.

The first anime line helps me to be sane and avoid unnecessary thoughts.
The second line guides me to be better as a person.

Years ago I used to love to debate the existence of God with religious people. It fascinated me that they can‚Äôt accept anything, but what was written and re-written thousands of times‚Äî thousands of years ago. No matter what you present to them they have the most answer, but if it wasn‚Äôt for god it wouldn‚Äôt blah blah blah. Or then I love and hate this one, ‚Äú the only explanation is God, that‚Äôs it).

Beyond this, I cant give advice. Supressing, not sharing our feelings leads to depression, and the best way to help someone suicidal, in my view, is to give them a safe space where they can express how they feel freely and without fear of judgement. If he cant do that with you, you should call medical help.

Now, I know you ask not to comment on you reading his search history, but I cant help but question what is up with that. Are we supposed to trust that you do so in his best interests without questioning? We dont know you, we cant be sure of what is really happening there. I hope it is in his best interest, but it is still a breach of privacy, and it might be a sign that there might be something not being quite right in your relationship, even if you truly love and care for him. But, since we cant know and have to work with what you're telling us and trust you have his best intentions in mind, its you who should think about what it might mean. I know you might be scared and looking for some reassurance or advice, but this is what my gut is telling me to say to you. Can you think about a way for him to be more comfortable about opening up to you? Is there something in your behavior that might cause him to shut himself off from you? We might truly love and care about people and still do something that might drive others away from us, unconsciously. If there is such a thing, identifying and understanding what that is might help him open up. This is not to say that you are to blame yourself for what is going through, and actually, it can be the case that you're the sort of person that often blames herself and takes too much responsability for the problems of others, and I don't want to add pressure to you or make you feel like you're responsible for him not opening up. I just want to give you something to think about, as I trust you are trying to find a way to help, and sometimes it helps to make some soul-searching. 

However, even if you are a great listener and someone most people can feel at ease with, some people will not open up no matter what. You may also question why is that. People often distance themselves due to fear. Where does that fear come from? What is he afraid of? You might want to think about how might have been his relationship with his parents, as it often defines our relationships with romantic partners. Or might it be work-related? Making these and other questions might help you drive closer to and understand the cause of the problem, and you might discover a way to give him support.",41,1617644897.0,t3_mkoer7,False

He always calls me to vent now when he's mad or upset. 

I say all of that to say, just be there for him. You know him better than anybody else, try to enforce the idea that you're here for him no matter what without pressuring him. Let him know how much you love him without smothering him. Aside from offering unconditional support, there really isn't a whole lot you can do.

I understand how confronting him could lead to you breaking your boyfriend's trust, however, it might be a necessary step. Especially since he's not being open about his mental health.    


Your boyfriend should seek professional help, immediately, and while he might not agree to it, *you* should contact someone. His search history and the note he's written are more than enough evidence to prove that he's potentially a danger to himself, and needs medical help.   


It's a very difficult decision, albeit, it must be done. You've got to contact the police/a suicide prevention hotline. Since I'm not sure where you're from, your options may vary. Calling a suicide prevention hotline and asking for assistance regarding your boyfriend's situation might be your best shot. Your boyfriend needs to be hospitalised, and you, alone, can't watch him 24/7, and you're not expected to do so.   


It's clear to me that you care about your boyfriend deeply, as you've also been together for 11 years, and this a very difficult position to be in, thus you may be feeling understandably overwhelmed. You can't magically fix this by talking to him, unfortunately, although you can still help your partner.   


So, again, please call a crisis support, get your boyfriend some medical help, immediately. Suicidal thoughts linger, and your loved one could end up harming himself, should his suicidal ideation be left untreated. Expect conflict, but do keep your boyfriend's current state in mind. Getting help is difficult. At the same time, your own well-being should still be a priority as well, so make sure that you take all necessary steps to take care of yourself while dealing with the situation, both physically and mentally.

It's not a bad idea to reach out to emergency services at this point. This is a lot of stress for one person to handle, understandably, and if something goes wrong or he does attempt you might take that guilt upon yourself if you don't seek help with this too. 

I am a mandated reporter for this kind of thing since I work for a state university, and usually at the point where someone has written notes or shown intent, I have to call.

The biggest take away for me was that I can't change them. I can be there for them and offer help but if I push my intended help on them it does more harm, it just pushes them away and makes everything worse. 

Pushing him to therapy won't work. Even if he decided to do it for you it is of no use when he doesn't want to do it himself. 

The absolute best you can do is search for help for yourself. 
Having a suicidal partner takes a huge toll on ones own mental health. Plus I bet you (like most people) have some learned destructive behaviour patterns.  If you learn healthier ways this will also be beneficial to your relationship, thus, by getting help yourself you can be the best you can be for him. 


My heart goes out to you. It is very heartbreaking and sad to see the one you love in so much pain and not being able to help often leaves one feeling helpless.

Because when I am thinking about different scenarios, it's always about a worst case scenario or ""what if"". This is called ""fortune telling"" cognitive distortion. 

What also helps me tremendously is imagining the upsetting thought as a bubble and putting it in the ocean where it slowly floats away over the horizon. I watch the thought go and I'm like ""ok it's gone, don't need to think about it anymore"". If I have a particularly bad thought I imagine myself putting it in a little weighted box and yeeting it really far into the ocean. Apparently attaching a visual image to your internal dialogue helps it ""stick"" more in your head. 

These are all CBT methods that my counseling taught me. I used to have to catch myself for what felt like almost every minute of every day. It's gotten much easier now. When I'm stressed, I know I will be much more susceptible to fortune telling, so I just try to be aware and prepared for that.

There's a part of your brain thats known as the ""task negative region"", lets call that TNR. Whenever your mind is wondering, and you're thinking about things that happened in the past, or are thinking about things that might potentially happen in the future; that because of heavy activity in your TNR.

&#x200B;

What meditation, over prolonged time, does is that it reduces (and in many cases, eliminates) the high activity in the TNR; which means your brain doesn't automatically go to the past or predict the future (and there is never anything good about being preoccupied with the past/future, its just a Petri dish for anxiety). So basically, your brain is \*in\* the present moment; and you aren't haunted by those crippling thoughts (in your case, depressive thoughts). Thats what meditation does.

&#x200B;

The reason why PTSD exaggerates this problem is that your mind is fine tuned to pay very, very close attention to highly traumatic/negative events; because it wants to remember every single detail about that experience, so that it can fight it off if it happens again. The issue is, those negative thoughts keep reoccurring and in doing so, activates the TNR heavily; and then it becomes this never ending loop where those thoughts never seem to go away. Its suffocating. Music helps because it pulls your attention away from your own mind and into the present moment; which is ultimately what you want to achieve. Meditation, when properly done, does this quite well - I believe you've come across this definition at least once, ""meditation is the art of being attentive to the present moment"". If music helps you out, meditation will help you out 10x. I hope things get better for you my friend. I'm cheering you on!",8,1600552995.0,t3_ivsx0k,False

ivsx0k,g5u7wul,TheAdlerian,"In my 20s I would do this and it was very dumb. 

I also had a gf who would do it. 

She would get mad at me for how she imagined I might react in certain situations. Also, she would have a dream about me, and be genuinely angry at me for what I did in the dream. I was prone to doing the imagined scenario thing until I woke up on day and stopped. 

It is especially prone to reactivating regarding relationship conflicts. For instance, I do not like my gf's relatives as they have a drug history. They have a long pattern of abuse toward her and yet she is hungry for their love, which I don't think will ever happen. 

Anyway, she was literally just on the phone with me telling me how her brother sent her a nice message. That instantly started me imagining them developing a relationship again, him having drug, her using them, and I could feel myself getting enraged. 

If I get angry about threats to our life, I become volcanic. 

So, I quickly reminded myself it's just a message and said, ""Oh well that's nice to hear"" because she has told me that she plans on loving him from a distance. So, I was getting angry about something that hasn't happened but then I reminded myself of that fact, and calmed down a bit. 

So, you have to become your own internal therapist and interrupt these fantasies. I typically talk to myself in a crude way and put down my stupidity. 

Also, you can use ""thought stopping techniques"" to destroy what you are seeing. When I was little, I would have scary thoughts before bed. I would picture Superman using his heat vision to burn the images away. You can do whatever your own version of that is. 

It is ""silly"" to upset yourself about things that aren't real, and so it's important to have a technique to do it.",2,1600538133.0,t3_ivsx0k,False

Just two days ago,  I called in sick to work due to grief/ mental health. I cried so hard I vomited,  and anytime my mind wasn't 100% occupied, I couldn't fight back the tears. The thing is, I *could* have gone into work, and my work would have likely distracted me enough, except that I work in the trades. Physical illness is already barely an excuse to miss work, mental illness even less so. But even more taboo than taking a mental health day is bringing your emotions to work (especially as a woman). I could have done my job, but my state of emotions would have been deemed inappropriate.

Needing to take time for your mental health can be damaging to a job performance, but a job can do irreparable harm to your mental health, and it's not your fault our society's priorities are royally fucked.

It really sounds like you felt dismissed by her response. Please know that 90% of the time, people working at the crisis/mental health/suicide lines are not mental health professionals. They are volunteers who have undergone hundreds of hours of crisis training. This does not make us mental health professionals. Sometimes there are licensed counselors volunteering there as well, but they are provided the exact same training. They are told to forget their own counselling training and to follow crisis guidelines because we are a **short term service**. Counselors create a **long term relationship** with you, crisis call centres do not.

We are trained to stop engaging in verbally abusive calls as it is a misuse of our service. Repeated offenders become blocked and banned from calling us.
It is likely that Rachel did not understand that it was a tic, even if it was clear to you, because it‚Äôs likely that she **is not a mental health professional** and is **not aware** of what tourette symdrome is. Next time if you decide to call a line, which I encourage you to do, please immediately start the call with a warning that you have tourettes and you cannot control tics that may be misinterpreted as verbal abuse so that you don‚Äôt get disengaged with the line!

That being said, it is understandable from your perspective why you would feel misunderstood. Feelings of psychosis during a time like this is incredibly frightening, and you needed some one to be there for you. 

Please don‚Äôt let this experience stop you from reaching out for help from lines! We genuinely want to be there to listen and support you the best way we can. **You weren‚Äôt dismissed for having tourettes and being a man.

In this case, you might have said, ""Hi, my name is leroy2007, and I am calling, b/c I am having a mental health crisis.  Before we get started, I need you to understand that I have Tourette syndrome, which causes uncontrollable verbal tics, which may come across as verbal outbursts, so I may say some things that you personally find offensive, but it's not intentional.  If we can try to stay focused on my reason for calling, that would be of great personal help to me.  Thank you.""

My guess is that most people would be open to this, and explaining the situation would go a long way in helping you procure the resources you're looking to access.  You might also do well to remember that the people answering phones at a suicide hotline are not necessarily trained mental health professionals.  A lot of the time, they are volunteers who are given minimal instruction on how to handle callers, a list of resources to pass along, and a general outline for how to impart this information to a caller.

You did not experience sexism.

It's long known - decades, actually - just not allowed to be spoken of - the number of men who call hotlines with the sole intention of abusing and harassing women. **So much so that it is, in fact, part of the training for hotline workers.** You can look this up and read numerous, well-written and researched articles on the phenomenon. Rape crisis hotlines get the worst kind of men as just one example: men who call to recount long, horrid, gory details of abuse **for the sole purpose of traumatizing the female hotline worker while they whack off at home.**

Your responder was doing the job she was given and reacted in the way that - **fortunately** \- she was allowed to (having boundaries). Many hotlines do not allow their respondents to hang up while being abused, which, guess what happens? PTSD...thanks to sociopaths calling for the purpose of harming them.

You even THINKING about getting her fired because she did not thank you for calling her a cunt makes you the asshole, period, and it takes a responder away from someone else who needs one. **Your pain actually does NOT allow you to abuse any kind of health care professional. Period.**

Responders are hard to come by and don't last long because of the amount of both horrifying calls they take and the abuse they encounter.

Call again, and START the call by explaining your Tourettes and what will happen, then ask for a male respondent if the person taking your call feels it best in that moment. You wrote a post specifically to complain about a woman not graciously allowing you to call her a CUNT  - the worst thing you can call a woman, soaked in hatred, over and over and you're literally talking about deriving satisfaction for her grievous offense against *you* by having her FIRED.

**I really wish the best for you but ngl, the entitlement in your post is stunning...but not surprising.** Had a woman fucked up when calling a hotline she'd be here beating *herself* up.  But you, you display how offended you are. How *she* wronged *you*. Grow up.

 I think its fair of her to be angry to be called a cunt and to draw a boundary, even if it is a tic of yours.

They do receive training on how to speak to callers, but that doesn't mean they are healthcare professionals, or being paid for their work.

Her excuse as to why she treated me like a child was ""you have the mental/emotional (i cant remember which) of a 14 (it may have been 12 i cant remember correctly) year old"" that fucking hurt along with the fact that a lot of my friends were getting freedoms i wasnt. Granted i was acting out but i was hurt and angry and miserable that i wasnt getting treated like a kid as an almost adult that i was constantly getting in fights with my mom over this that i was an only child who felt teamed up against in those fights because my parents believe in joint parenting because i constantly had to apologize for said fights but my mom never had to that i was constantly getting crticized by her for not owning up to shit i did but when i pointed out that she does the exact same thing her excuse was ""i do it at work all the time"" that she only apologized to me when she felt like she did something wrong and not when i said i felt hurt a lot of shit she did made me miserable and suicidal and act out cause i had no proper way to vent my feelings.  She went to church she acted nice in public and so everyone who meets her doesnt believe or finds it hard to believe this shit went on and the people i live with (i live in a group home) never say they dont believe me but theyve met my mom and i feel so ungrateful when i hear about their backgrounds and i invalidate myself. A big reason why i couldnt vent was because if i called my friend to vent about arguments i was ""telling on her"" and ""making her look bad"" they psychiatrist i saw while living with them only really heard things from my parents pov cause i didnt feel like i could be open with my parents in the session that they were still going in when i was 18. I didnt ask them not to go in cause i had spent all that mental energy on getting my mom not to go into my therapy sessions with me. 


So yes im resentful of my mom yes i look like an ungrateful bitch yes i feel like i shouldnt resent my mom cause i was a lot better off than most ppl but i still feel that way and this post was very validating",6,1589155324.0,t3_gh5k0z,False

My mother is now in pretty rough shape from her years of running, moving and straight hopping from state to state combined with mental illness and drug abuse.  I know I don't owe her nothing but I try to make sure she has what she needs.  She hasn't changed, in fact I should be sleeping right now so I can work in 3 hours but after 5 random calls I finally answered my phone and my mother did her normal cry for attention by going to the ER because I didn't visit in person.  I had flowers and donuts delivered so out of  desperation she called 911 because she had hurt her arm and taken an ambulance to the hospital.  There's no other family around and unless she's handing out her narcotics then none of her ""friends"" will be there to pick her up.  She's almost 70 and still am addict.  Even when she's crying to me about not having good and I take some to her she's meeting me at the car and I can't come in which she only does when she has people over that I wouldn't agree with.  If I could live with myself I would let her rot in her miserable life but I haven't learned how to.  I dont owe her anything and I can't count how many times she left us as kids so she could run off with a new man or to continue getting high.  She doesn't deserve the name of Mom.

igq8oo,g2vei25,whattheflyingfuck2,I know this might not be an answer you want to hear but you should at least try meditation guided meditation that you view your thoughts on clouds just passing by or on a leaf in a river floating away from you lay back and watch these thoughts on the cloud or leaf without commenting on them let them come and go,84,1598410023.0,t3_igq8oo,False
igq8oo,g2w1end,None,"Ah man, I feel you. Almost destroyed my relationship two weeks ago because of my overthinking and me getting insanely jealous. What helped me was meditation and stoicism. I've started reading The Daily Stoic, which is perfect imo, if you don't have a lot of time and you want to learn more about stoicism. You read one chapter a day and it always takes you less then 5 minutes. I just read it with my morning coffee and it slowly eases you into the ideas of stoicism. I'm also reading Meditation by Marcus Aurelius but I find that a bit diffcult at times, but those are my two reccommendations for books if you wanna look into them.  


Now as the overthinking goes, it's important to realize that you can stop this, because it's in your head. The things in your head are actually the only things in your life that you can influence and control. You've identified the problem and you realized that it's your own overthinking that's making you sad and not actually the actions of others. I bow to you for realizing that on your own, because it took me so long to accept it after I read it. It's not other people making you sad, it's either yourself letting them make you sad or you making yourself sad with overthinking. Since you've realized that, I think you're already on the correct path friend.  


If you repeat something in your head enough, you will start to believe it, which is why overthinking can be very problematic if left alone.  


Whenever those thoughts pop up in my head now, I just sort of, inspect them? In order to understand what you're feeling, just ask yourself why am I feeling this way? Just keep asking yourself why, why, why until you stumble to the root of your problem. For me, it was insecurities and trauma from childhood, for you it might be something completely else. It's important to realize that this won't happen overnight, or during a day or two. Please don't get discouraged if you don't figure it out immediately, it's a slow process. It took me around 2-3 weeks to realize the roots of my problems which caused my overthinking and I still don't think I'm done.  


Now, if you found the roots of your problems, it becomes so much easier to handle emotions like these. Because by the time you figure out the core problem, you realize a lot of things about yourself. Now, when those emotions pop up in your head, you quickly KNOW, that they are fake, that they are unreal and ungrounded in reality. You KNOW that they are just a product of your own imagination. Which in turn makes it easier to stop yourself from having these thoughts. I sometimes laugh at myself now when I catch myself overthinking and soon, you will too.  


Also, this might be a bit random, but what helped me calm down during one of the overthinking episodes, was knowing that people don't want to hurt you. When my gf would go out with one of her lifelong guy friends and my brain would already be doing 100mph on the overthinking highway, I calmed down by thinking that she doesn't go out with him to hurt me or to embarass me, but to be with her friend, and even though I felt hurt by that, it was my own fault and she didn't intend this.  


I hope this post was somewhat helpful for you. The general idea to take away from this is that what you're doing is completely normal (though not good) and everyone goes through a stage in their life when they do this. It isn't an unfixable problem and just by you realizing that it is a problem, you are already on the path of healing.  


Of course, if you want to visit a therapist, that's completely fine and encouraged and it WILL help you. If you don't feel like going through this alone, therapist is a good choice. You could also talk to your friends or feel free to DM me whenever, I'm not on reddit often so might respond slowly, but I will respond. You got this man :)",51,1598427403.0,t3_igq8oo,False

Second of all, while a few points you‚Äôve addressed are things we can‚Äôt change by ourselves, there are some things you might be able to do to help your situation and your mindset. 

I know this one might sound like a cliche, but if you‚Äôre able to afford/find it, I recommend going to a decent therapist. Being able to talk to someone qualified, who may have some tips for you when you‚Äôre feeling at your worst, can help tremendously.

Another thing to think about, if you haven‚Äôt already, is different types of contraception. While there‚Äôs no *one size fits all* solution when it comes to birth control, and can sometimes require trial and error to find the right type for you, certain methods of contraception can reduce period cramps and flow (some people find their periods even stop altogether). Definitely worth discussing different options with a doctor.

Perhaps going to the gym might also be an option for you? This could be a great way to get fitter and stronger, which might help you to feel more confident and less vulnerable. A lot of gyms also host a variety of self-defence classes which is another great option, especially if they‚Äôre exclusively classes for women. If going to the gym isn‚Äôt an option for you, going for a run during the day (maybe even with a friend or family member) is another great fitness option.

And lastly, see if you can speak to the women in your life you admire and care about, and ask them what things they like about being a woman. This might seem overly simplified, but sometimes these conversations can help us look at something in a different light.

I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre feeling this way, and that I don‚Äôt have any overnight solutions for you. I hope that at least one of these things proves helpful, and that with a little time you start to feel a little less alienated from your body. Best of luck!",80,1707421786.0,t3_1am2rtm,False

You might have a job, you might have a partner, you might have children you responsible for, you might have a house you have to clean, you might have a civic organization you're part of. Whatever your obligations are write them down in a list.

Now look at this list and see if there's anything that you can eliminate or postpone or delegate to somebody else. Obviously you can't eliminate something like your responsibility to your children. You might be able to delegate cleaning your house for example to your partner or hire someone to do it for you. You could eliminate being part of a civic organization if it's just causing you stress.

Okay so hopefully you could have eliminated or postponed or delegated something in the previous step. If you didn't that's okay. Continue to look at the list of obligations that you have. Now we're trying to see if there's anything that we could take a break from. If you have a job is there any way that you could talk to your employer and take some time off of work? If you have a partner is there any way that you could talk to them and tell them that you're overwhelmed and you can't really give them 100% right now as much as you'd like to? If you have children is there a way you could send them off with relatives for a weekend just to get a break and reset? If you're a student, could you talk to your professors about any extensions on your work or could you talk to someone at your University about what's going on and see what options you have if you're suffering from some mental health issues?

Hopefully by now there's been at least something you could eliminate, delegate to someone else, or take a break from. If there's absolutely no way you can get out of anything, my best advice to you would be to take at least small little pieces of the day to yourself and try some grounding techniques. Really take the time to have that cup of tea at work. Smell the aroma, feel the sensation of heat, and really taste it. be in the moment even if it's just for that 10 seconds and forget about everything else.

Take your shoes and socks off and go outside. stand in the grass and curl your toes into the ground and feel the sensation of the grass and dirt on your feet. Forget about everything else and just feel yourself being grounded literally on the Earth.

Take a few deep breaths, into your nose and out through your mouth. Next acknowledge five things that you can see, four things that you can touch, three things that you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. try to get out of your mind and into your body and focus on your sensory experience. Forget about everything else and just be present for what your body experiencing.

TL;DR
Try to see if you can take time away from your responsibilities, eliminate responsibilities if possible, or delegate them to others if possible. Focus on coping techniques such as grounding and being present in the moment to cope with the responsibilities that you do have.",10,1613342158.0,t3_ljv1k4,False

mzmt4k,gw32hre,bandrews4795,"I like the message but I want to share a dissenting view (which actually may not be that contrary to what op is saying, if you think about it):

If all of my memory is trauma, isn't it normal at that point?

I recall everything, even when I don't want to. Obsessively, endlessly, in what I call thought spirals until I reach a logical conclusion.

I wasn't abused, or neglected, and I had an easy life, but I can't turn my brain off. I react reflexively to things I remember without realizing it. This has actually saved my ass quite a few times, but it has caused problems when I absolutely felt I HAD to do something. What's worse is that I've done this to the point that I seem to be pushing forward, past the present and reacting to things that 'might' happen. Nothing seems new anymore, I have trouble being surprised now. The moment I see something, it is like I've always known it and we're repeating something that has already happened. Even your post feels like a well worn path that I have seen hundreds, thousands, infinite times before and I can't show any proof that I've seen it.

Don't get me wrong, I have been through traumatic events, but they seem like a relatively small part of my problem. Every moment, my mind seems to be in pain as it simply accepts all information. If a pain is constant, you get used to it. On some level I am suffering but on a whole I'm lost in a sea of information, following instinct and pondering the framework of all knowledge. The way I see it, my biggest danger is accepting that as a new existence and withdrawing into my mindscape.

As I understand, some people would kill to get a slice of what I just described, thinking it's a blessing. It's a flood, a sea, I can pick out specific points of knowledge but it would take eternities to get it all out. Knowing how things flow doesn't always mean I can change it, or that I can fully see what's going to happen. I follow patterns, tweak my own, and hope for the best. Sometimes I have even found that I hide knowledge from myself by willfully ignoring a memory.

Furthermore, as extreme and unbelievable as this sounded, I'm actually watering down my life experience. Every wrong choice, every mistake, every unknown, every unsolvable problem, rattling around in my head until all I could do was simply work the memories as my brain seemed to want to. This was debilitating, distracting, and consumed monstrous amounts of mental energy. My personal and professional lives suffered, I made mistake after mistake and dug my self-made hole deeper and deeper. It got better, but it sucked for sooooooo long.

Of course I had to get it under control, and I'm working on taking advantage of it. Right now, all I got is basic situational awareness, and strangely, an eye for the ladies. I always check for a feeling about whether it's the right time to do something. Seems to work. One of the funniest manifestations of my strange intuition is how I will seemingly change up my entire day just to get a good look at a nice butt. Yeah, it's a bit perverted, but it happens. It's not like stalker level, either. It ends up being in passing, like stuck behind someone in line, or a woman bending over right when I come around a corner. I don't make an effort to consciously remember people and their schedules, and I don't think any of them repeat often aside from ones I live near, but it definitely feels better than chance. Reminds me of the anime trope of females falling on the protagonist or vice/versa.

Edit: I'm trying to learn how to bring back the 'surprise' feeling without going off the rails. What I've been doing recently is habitually avoiding direct recall, and thus the strange habit of looking for booty seems to have come about. I'm also on the spectrum, they say that similar people traumatize easier and it seems my dial was set to 'always'.",3,1619550758.0,t3_mzmt4k,False

I probably get a 25% response rate when I reach out to therapists for initial consultation. I understand therapists have their own lives, but considering the line of work, it's so incredibly unprofessional to leave those mentally vulnerable feeling even more alone. At the very least, therapists should update their voicemail/websites to say they are not accepting new clients.",117,1621371643.0,t3_nflnez,False

nflnez,gyn2hc3,GreatWentGin,"I have PTSD so severe that I've been unable to work since 2018. Insurance obviously changed when I stopped working, I had to leave my AMAZING therapist, and I tried a few that would accept the new insurance. I go weekly.

One really did nothing for me, just listened - which I appreciated but I needed more. I had a great therapist before, so I knew what I needed.

The second one I found during COVID, so it was all phone or facetime sessions. I never really felt connected to her, and she went on vacation (I knew it was coming, I was ok with skipping two weeks).  I had an appointment on a Wednesday and it would be my first in three weeks, she texted me at 7 am that Sunday morning to say that she was having trouble getting paid by my insurance company, and would have to cancel my upcoming appointment.  

She didn't ask how I was doing, she didn't ask me to try calling my insurance company to help her, she didn't even schedule the next appointment.

It felt horrible, I felt abandoned. 

After a week she texted again saying that she would need me to contact them. I did, I spoke with someone immediately who said that they JUST got her invoices because for 14 weeks she was sending them to the wrong agency. 

I told the therapist I wouldn't be needing any future appointments and that I understood I was just a client/patient, but that I needed a therapist who actually cared about me. 

Since then, I've reached out to 11 different therapists. I was able to speak to 2 upon initial call (which is difficult for me since I have phone anxiety) who weren't accepting new patients, one replied via email that he didn't take my insurance. Never heard back from anyone else. It's been since July 2020 that I've had a therapist. 

I wish there were some kind of *liason* independent from the therapists, psychiatrists, etc. that could help people find the help they need, without us having to deal with the rejection or the stress and confusion of insurance and whatnot.",30,1621386006.0,t3_nflnez,False

n8tqix,gxkwxk0,OohYeahOrADragon,"My therapist is a former Buddhist monk. I said something akin to this worry and he said:

>western aesthetic convinces you that happiness is a destination goal. 'If I just had this I'd be happy', 'after I do that, then I can start my life'. But the goal always moves when you get to that point. We go to school..after I finish school I can do whatever I want..but when you finish senior year, you get to the next stage and you're not happy either.

>Eastern cultures frame happiness as a homeostasis. 'If I didn't have XYZ in my life I wouldn't be happy' If you don't feel happy it is because something is missing from its place on your happiness shelf..stolen like the Mona Lisa.

n8tqix,gxkvupp,redditcommentt,"for me I feel like there were certain turning points in my life where something happened that fundamentally meant I could never just be happy like other people. Things like right now mother's day and I see friends tagging their moms in posts and I kind am just reminded that I will never do that or have that relationship. or friends announcing they are getting married, having kids, starting fantastic careers. It feels like there is this stone cold harsh reality in front of me that just isn't in front of them.

And people will tell you that ""everybody struggles"" and ""you never know what other people are going through,"" which has a lot of truth to it but isn't the whole story. When you go through life carrying this heavy burden it really starts to grind you down. And you will meet people who you can just tell are in the same position you are, and you will meet people who clearly are not and maybe have never even been. It doesn't mean you are 'doomed' to this life and accepting that you will spend a lifetime carrying the weight of mental health struggles isn't the same as 'giving up.' I think you'll have pockets of happiness but frankly all that really matters is you see it out to the end. You literally never know what's around the corner and having spent your life carrying this weight... you might realize it was training and preparing you for something bigger.

n8tqix,gxl1cnr,None,"In  ""Sapiens"" Yuval Noah Harari argues  that we all have a ""fixed"" happiness rate set at birth. 

For example if you are an 8 (out of 10) you always go back to 8 even though there might be fluctuations in between (death, divorce, winning the lottery), if you are a 5 you always return to 5 even if great things happen. 

Some of this is science backed but I think you can increase this number a little bit (and it improves with age, according to some other research).

I am normally a 6-ish but I have brought myself to a permanent 7,5 I think.

Suggestions:

1) Yes, do accept it first. This won't take away your mental anguish but it will still be **extremely emancipating.** 

This is something you will live with forever. Understand and accept.

2) With acceptance comes forgetting about this ""life you want."" Most of the things in my life haven't gone the way I wanted, so let me tell you (speaking from early 40s), don't fantasize about a good life. **Take whatever comes.**

3) Taking whatever comes is actually the thing that improves your happiness. But doing it is very hard. You actually have to spend **time and energy** on it. This is where you try to get into yoga, meditation, walking in the woods or whatever works for you and try to discipline yourself to do this on a *daily basis (this is the hard part!)*  for at least a few minutes. This will make accepting easier.

4) If at any point in your life you feel like you could benefit from the help of a mental health professional (also finding the right one is important), consider seeing one. Medicating has proven to be an improvement in my case (ADHD), therapy might work for others, but remember the key to feeling okay is **number two**, regardless of your brain chemistry.",9,1620631613.0,t3_n8tqix,False

n8tqix,gxlsre0,MajoraFeels,"There are a few things I can say to this:

1. I would have put myself in the 'born to be happy' category you've mentioned - I didn't experience any proper trauma til 28 and considered myself to ' just run happy'. Fast forward a few shocking and awful events, and now I'm often struggling to run at all. I have often felt 'broken' or 'damaged'. But - if I was happy category before and now I've switched, it would stand to reason that a series of good events for you could shift you into the opposite camp, too.
2. The universe IS our mind. Reality is what we think it is and it comes down to perception and response, basically. Have you tried Zen meditation? It is said to encourage a sort of transcendent view of life's problems, an emotional clarity, that leads to a sense inner calm and control. Regular practice also dispels (to an extent, obviously) physical and emotional pain. It requires consistency and commitment but I really believe it works (I've just started). 
3. Tony Robbins says often that our expectations have a lot to say for being happy/being seriously unhappy. If your blueprint for happiness is a specific goal in life, or a destination happiness (I saw also that someone else replied to you about this), you could be the most fortunate 'born happy' person and never actually feel happy because you just don't have that one certain thing, or you're not yet a mother/father/professional shellfish wrangler etc etc. I have a friend obsessed with making it in gaming PR. For him, it's his happiness holy grail. Meanwhile, he's having existential crisis every other day because he isn't a gaming PR boss and he feels the universe is purposefully fucking him over. Ambition can be a cruel mistress when you corner her into too tight a space to work. I would say: be kind to yourself and have goals, but don't try to control life too much. The things that make us happiest are often the things that pleasantly surprise us :)
4. Happiness is just a concept. Remember that. Different people have different opinions on what it means and how to catch it. If you feel like you've never truly experienced joy, to hope that you can someday is completely feasible! Keep hoping and try to work on your self worth. I personally think this is very important for feeling happy.
5. You could physically have a chemical imbalance that stops you feeling joy. Have you been to a doc about feeling so down all the time?

Sorry, I went on a bit <3

Things CAN get better. The main thing to do is to look after yourself and seek help now. Remember, you are bringing something to the world no one else can and you have so many unforeseen joys to still experience :)",3,1620653112.0,t3_n8tqix,False

Think about how he will use this strength and this knowledge to get through this hard time. 

And you are strong too, even if it doesn't always feel like it. You have had to fight your own thoughts every day, something that is unimaginable for so many people. But you've made it here now having raised a beautiful family. You made it through every day of depression and you are here expressing your love and concern for your children and their families. Fighting against depression like you've done takes so much strength, and I believe that you also have the strength to make it through this.

Everything that's happening now is scary.

Therefore, there may just be an issue with trust. 

The discomfort we feel when receiving a compliment or when a kindness is done on our behalf may be closely related to our past experiences where a person's kind actions were due to unkind intentions.

Not only do we lose trust in that person (these people), but we also lose trust in kind actions on our behalf altogether.

If this isn't you then yes it may be about how you feel about yourself. 

In either case, in order to overcome this insecurity, we must learn to show appreciation. If not for their intentions then for their actions. Find any perspective that allows you to feel appreciation. Get comfortable with expressing gratitude.

egu3ge,fcb3q1d,Hydn7822,"More often than not , I was put down when I went through depression, all involving family. I have read many, many stories people ave to share. I noticed something, which is not typical. I was not concerned with what they (family)  said. I do not mean   the typical ""Fuck them, I dont care what they think!"", because, lets face it, we all care to a point. Its ingrained in all of us to care what people think of us. Others can argue this point all they'd like. They have, and they will. Thats also perfectly natural. I am not saying I am better, or otherwise stronger, for not allowing the negativity to get to me. Simply because, well, I had plenty of my own negativity.

The reason we have this stigma, which is slowly losing ground btw, believe it or not, is the language we use. When one hears ""depression"", they think of what is called ""situation depression"". Say, reading a sad novel, or watching a sad movie. It is all in the language. What society needs is to learn the difference between ""This movie is fucking depressing"" and ""I hate myself, and I am not sure why, but I want to end my life as quickly as possible, because the pain is that bad."" We also need to stop segregating ourselves. We need to stop saying ""They have no idea what its like, theyre not me, they do not feel so bad on a daily basis that simply making ones bed is terrifying."" What we need, is to be as patient with ""those people"", as we expect them to be with us, or anyone dealing with daily torment.

As for the topic at-hand, ye. When I was first forced to acknowledge what I was going through, it hit like a fucking freight train. I do understand what it takes to be a ""man"", aka ""tough"". I knew all this long before depression hit, thus I was not at all concerned with looking weak. Logic dictates that if you are feeling weak, and do not hide it , show no shame in it etc, then you are tough. Simply sharing what you feel takes courage. Again, logic.

Also, someone going through hell is best to not lash out because another suggests it is possible to beat, because it is. It does take a shit-ton of work, but thats life in general. Whether you deal with anxiety/depression/etc, you struggle. It does not matter if one is not depressed, we all have our own battles. Lastly, there is something to be said about ""getting on with it"", about being stronger. People say this, it sounds condescending,but it is sound advice.",3,1577581953.0,t3_egu3ge,False

CBT does have it's place but it's always seemed like a surface level therapy to me. It aims to change negative thought patterns, which is great, but it often doesn't delve into *why* someone has those negative thought patterns. The Person-Centred approach looks at things like conditions of worth, the self concept, the self actualising tendency, etc. Personally I feel that gives much deeper healing than simply changing someone's thinking. In my opinion it also helps for longer. CBT can give quick symptom reduction, but if you don't focus on the why then that won't last.",74,1623346224.0,t3_nwmpz1,False

Years later after leaving them and the program I did more research about CBT and found that a lot of the jargon and quips and phrases she used were like, word for word from the original (author? Creator?) Of CBT and I felt really put out.

That therapist and I abruptly ended on a weird note and I always felt guilty about it and felt like I was a failure who didn't finish the program.

I threaten him with leaving (indirectly) and he whines about how it takes time, and then starts to read out of a CBT textbook as if more theory is what I need. Over reliance on it.

nwmpz1,h1a6sqc,oraclekneepads,"Hello friend, I think you raise an excellent point. I wanted to provide the perspective of someone practicing mental health support to shed a light on why it is the case, at least where I am from (uk). I am not a qualified therapist but here we have a more junior position that I do, whilst I work alongside a variety of qualified therapists in a range of disciplines (art therapy, drama therapy, psychodynamic and CBT). In my role I deliver CBT based therapeutic work for my clients. As I have progressed I have encountered the situations you describe- trying to work through CBT excercises with people who's situation is not able to be thought out of, people in abusive households and in lots of cases, people who just need someone to listen to them and take them seriously for maybe the first time in their life. I work with a supervisor who is trained in more psychodynamic approaches and we have excellent case discussions about my clients but that I can not implement many of because I'm limited to CBT. 

The reason for the prevalence of CBT based therapy appears to be it's ability to generate 'outcome data'. Unfortunately, for my role I spend an immense amount of time inputting various self report measures and, most  importantly for justification of our funding, goal measures (I.e. client achieved a goal they set out). CBT in this format can be great because it supposedly shows if the therapy 'worked'. While training I met some of the key people who pushed this agenda in the UK and essentialy their reasoning was forgivable- they wanted to get government funded mental health services as far reaching and available as they could, so the choice for CBT (and the CBT lite sort of thing I do) was a pragmatic choice as it can reduce the amount of time needed to train us as well as be somewhat effective for some people.

So while it is all about money really, in what will be able to be justified for funding, one thing my first supervisor told me was comforting. Apparently it has been demonstrated that regardless of the approach used, the most predictive thing for seeing progress is a positive therapeutic relationship between client and therapist- and ironically this was a huge part of Carl Rogers (CBT founder) original ethos. Unfortunately we now get a lot of diluted therapeutic options (too short, too narrowly focused etc) and I do fear this is combined with a batch of young practitioners like myself, who simply see 'evidence based' as meaning 'the best' and who focus too much on worksheets, thought challenging etc and forget the importance of being a person with another person.",21,1623334863.0,t3_nwmpz1,False

On a more macro level, therapists can‚Äôt solve large scale societal issues like wealth inequality. This is where the role of advocacy and organizing comes in.

And it's been done with a highly individualized and medicalized mindset, where therapy is conceived of as fixing a disorder that is wrong with the person.  And CBT was developed very heavily within that mindset.  And it's complicated by that if a therapist hasn't been in poverty, or in an abusive relationship, some things that may seem obvious to them aren't actually viable options for you.

mila47,gt5cuhu,hydropillz,"Personally, I feel that court ordered treatment is a good idea in this situation. So long as he follows the treatment plan, it won't be any different from getting regular help with medication, therapy, and anything else he needs. If he steps off the treatment plan and starts threatening you again, having COT in place makes your life so much easier to get protection. Basically, all you will have to do is call the cops, say he's court ordered, that he isn't doing x thing that's causing the new episode, and they will take him to a psych hospital where they will stabilize him.

Yes, he is going through what will probably be the scariest part of his life. Like others said, he'll need compassion and empathy when he gets through this. But I've seen too many people get seriously hurt because they think things like, 'he is my husband, he would never do that,' or 'we can get through this together, I don't want to be mean by forcing him.' You should always show compassion towards others because this isn't their fault and they can't do anything about it. However, you should never sacrifice yourself so someone else can get/feel better.

The one very comforting thing the admitting psychiatrist said was that often when psychosis comes on that rapidly, the person's recovery is more optimal. Not that I didn't go home and cry my eyes out when I left the hospital every time for fear that my partner was never going to be the same, but I held onto what the doctor said when I would start to really worry. It did take time for him to recover, and the first time we left the hospital together to get a burger it was WEIRD but now we laugh together about that time in our lives. We even wrote an album together about our experience as catharsis and as a way to talk about mental health and hopefully help reduce stigma. We are SUPER lucky that the mental health floor he was transferred to was amazing, and that we have a great support system and live in Canada so we didn't pay a cent, but please feel free to reach out if you want to chat.

He needs consistent medication, therapy, and support and COT is the best option for him at the time. You need to focus on taking care of and supporting yourself while he is taken care of.

. . . c) ""deep cleaners"" like Eye-Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing (EMDR), Hakomi Body Centered Psychotherapy (HBCP), Somatic Experiencing Psychotherapy (SEPt), Sensorimotor Processing for Trauma (SP4T), and the Neuro-Affective Relational Model (NARM).

One can look up all of those by name online. The CBTs deconstruct one's inaccurate beliefs, values, ideals, principles, convictions, rules, codes, regulations and requirements about how we or they (or the world) should / must / ought / have to be.  DBT, MBCT, ACT, MBBT and MBSR are terrific for emotional symptom management. EMDR, HBCT, SEPt, SP4T and NARM are first-rate for memory-reprocessing, sense-making and detachment from the conditioning, programming, etc. 

To find the clinicians who know how to use these psychotherapies, look on the ""therapists"" and ""psychiatrists"" sections of the *Psychology Today*.com clinician locator, on the ""find-a-doctor/specialty/psychiatry"" section of the WebMD website, the SAMHSA's treatment facility locator, and -- for DBT specialists in particular -- on the Behavioraltech.org website. If you dig a little on each page, you will be able to see which therapies they use. Then interview *them* as though they were applying for a job with *your* company. Most psychiatrists, btw, are *not* therapists themselves (they are medication specialists), but can refer you to those who are, and are often excellent sources of referral.

The mass murders and death numbers refer to the date when I originally posted this so the numbers are different as of today, though according to the numbers, we are set to outpace mass murders of last year. Racism and hate are not mental illnesses. Violence is not a mental illness. Entitlement, revenge, anger, sense of injustice, criminal activity are not mental illness (these are what most mass shootings are contributed to). There are mass shootings on average every single day in the US. They are not all mentally ill. In fact, according to research and facts, very few are. 

Facts exist. I'm sick and tired of people's opinions that someone must be mentally ill to commit mass murder. That is wrong. It's just wrong. There is no argument here. This has been studied by experts for years. Your opinion does not matter. Your opinion does not trump experts, research, studies, and facts. 

______________________________________________

My previous comment:

Fact time:

MENTAL ILLNESS IS NOT THE REASON FOR GUN VIOLENCE. 

If this false narrative continues, and that is all people plan to change in gun control, nothing in our county will change. 

Yes, you hear about instances of someone mentally ill committing a heinous act of violence. But taking action toward the mentally ill is the exact same response as Trump banning Muslims from this country. Correlation does not equal causation. 

Here are the FACTS:

As of this writing, there have been 281 mass shootings in the US this year (a mass shooting is defined by 4 or more people shot). Today is the 285th day of the year. There have been 48,446 incidents this year resulting in 12,115 deaths and 24,653 injuries. These statistics do not take into account suicides and suicide attempts with guns (source: http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/)

Fact: The vast majority of people with mental health problems are no more likely to be violent than anyone else

Fact: Americans are 20 times more likely to die of gun violence than citizens of any other developed nation. Yet mental health rates are the same. 

Fact: Most people with mental illness are not violent

Fact:  Only 3%-5% of violent acts can be attributed to individuals living with a serious mental illness. 

Fact: People with severe mental illnesses are over 10 times more likely to be victims of violent crime than the general population.

(source: US Department of Health and Human Services)

Fact: The CDC has been forbidden by Congress to study gun violence- both data and research. They get zero allocation of funds as well as the Congress committee ""reminds CDC that the longstanding general provision's intent is to protect rights guarantee by the second amendment. The restriction is to prevent activity that would undertake activities (to include gun collection data) for current or future research, including under the title ""gun violence prevention,"" that would be used in any manner to result in a future policy, guidelines, or recommendations to limit access to guns, ammunition, or create e list of gun owners."" (Appropriations Bill, 2016)

Fact: Black markets thrive more when an item is *legal* because they can use the legality of the item to obtain access and then skirt laws. This explains the proliferation of unregistered, or filed/altered guns on the streets, yet there is a minimal black market in countries where guns have been banned.  

Fact: An analysis of data from 171 countries showed a country's rate of gun ownership is a far better predictor of public mass shootings than indicators of mental illness. If mental illness were the driving factor, one would expect the countries with highest suicide rates to have higher rates of public mass shootings. But that's not what happens. Instead, the criminologists found gun ownership per person is the best predictor.

Fact: About one in five mass murderers shows evidence of psychosis or delusions, according to Dr. Michael Stone, a forensic psychiatrist who maintains data on some 350 murderers going back more than a century. The other 80 percent do not have a severe, diagnosable disorder and have many of the problems that nearly everyone has to manage at some point in life: anger, isolation, mood swings, resentments, jealousy.  Another analysis of 71 lone-actor terrorists and 115 mass killers, researchers convened by the Department of Justice found the rate of psychotic disorders to be about what Dr. Stone had discovered: roughly 20 percent.

Fact: The number of victims in mass murders studied decade by decade remained small until the 60s which has a direct correlation with accessibility of semiautomatic weapons. 

Using mental health is a cop-out by the gun industry to once again shift blame. It's like their saying, ""guns don't kill people, people kill people.""

If mental health access to guns were more regulated, it is speculated there would be a drop in suicides, but have absolutely no impact on homicides. But yes, it is a fact that we need to improve the mental health treatment in this country. When jails become the main mental health treatment centers, it is because people with mental health issues often turn to drugs and alcohol to cope, and then crimes result from the drug domino effect. Had they had access to services prior, they could have saved their own lives from a life of crime. But that does not prevent the actual number of gun deaths in this country.

Using mental health as an excuse for gun violence further perpetuates stigma, and falsely demonizes a community of people who are not at all responsible for the violence yet pay the price of these false perceptions in how society views them (as being potential violent threats). 

So much needs to be done to change laws, prevent the proliferation of guns on the streets, keep guns out of the hands of criminals and domestic abusers, end gang violence, change mentality, and more. But if your only focus is on keeping guns out of the hands of those with mental illness, you will have accomplished nothing.",2,1566190066.0,t3_cs4xq7,False

But I disagree that you can just talk to people instead. It is good to talk to people and discuss ideas etc, but a good therapist is an expert person that builds up a plan for you, helps discover your past, dig up family issues, finding causes for your behavior. He/she will point out new ideas, new PoVs, explains the dynamics of human mind and behavior, etc. It cannot be substituted with talking to random people.

If you are with a good therapist, you will get fantastic results and you can fix your problems. A good therapist is hard to find, sometimes you meet with worse ones (just like me before). You need to close the work with them, and find new one",4,1684594946.0,t3_13mo21z,False

Some companies don‚Äôt pay out for nearly a year. For years, and especially since covid, insurance companies have targeted mental health to recover lost funds. That also doesn‚Äôt account the amount of money it takes just to get licensed and keep your license with ongoing education. The system is corrupt. Most therapists don‚Äôt charge 300 and are just trying to live.

a8jrap,ecbinmy,Markoni1982,"For some people it is good to label some mental states as 'depression'. For others, it is not. It might  be frightening for them and it can carry onerous burden of self-stigma. So you must understand what is the right path for you. An empathetic therapist will understand your struggles and help you to obtain more coherent  sense of identity. 

Sounding like a depressed person should not stop you from asking for help.

I suspect your objection may have something to do with how meditation is sometimes waved around like a panacea for what are often very complex and/or unsolvable difficulties. For these situations, it is far more desirable to have someone that is willing to listen and empathize with us, and then help us develop constructive solutions, rather than reflexively offer us a magic pill that will supposedly make us feel better.

Last year I had to do a suicide screening for a 3rd grader as the school nurse and possibly the only one trained on suicide screenings even though I'm only there part time. The kid came back as not so bad that I needed to call 911 lest he immediately try something, but moderate risk. The only real resource I had for him right then was a contract like you mention. I take a little solace in the fact that it included things that trigger his sad feelings, people that he feels comfortable talking to at school and at home if he feels sad, examples of things he can do to let out his feelings without hurting himself or others, etc. I know from personal experience that all that doesn't really help in the moment, but it was all I had from my training. I told him that I am always here to talk to him (but only 3 days a week..). I made a referral for our district support center to get him set up with some counseling but I haven't had time to verify if that has been set up or if he has been going. I told his parents (getting ahold of them was a whole ordeal and included a home visit). I checked in with him at the start of this school year and he seemed to be doing well. But that's really all I can do and I think that's going above and beyond what I'm technically required to do. I have so much other case management, program coordination, etc. For this and 2 other schools. This school really needs a full time therapist who is only there to be a therapist.

bs77u9,eolig9s,FruitScentedAlien,"TW: SELF HARM

I'm not sure this should have that warning but its better to put it than to upset anyone.

I remember in my freshman year of high school someone who became a good friend of mine later  in those years went to our guidance counselor and confessed she self harmed and our guidance counselor of YEARS at that time told her it was for attention and that's pretty much all he said. What I don't understand about that is he never actually got her any help. Maybe that's because her parents were strict and would get mad at her for being depressed but I think he should have done more. Idk. I just can't believe he told her that as if it would make anything better. Schools act like they're so concerned and worried but don't actually do anything. Luckily at my school now they have a mental health club. I would have loved something like that when I attended there. Maybe it could have saved some people's lives.",3,1558671379.0,t3_bs77u9,False
bs77u9,eolpmg5,ItsCryptillian,"While most of my trauma stems from school and the current school system I‚Äôm in, I am extremely lucky.

I have been manipulated and emotionally abused by staff at my middle school, mental health professionals, and my family played a huge role in my mental state worsening. Because of all this, my mental illnesses are literally debilitating. I can‚Äôt function in society like a normal person which is hard to explain to someone who could see me as ‚Äúperfectly fine‚Äù face to face.

Because of how bad my panic attacks would get, how deeply depressed I was, how bad my depression and OCD had gotten, I ended up going to special Ed. In there we have paras, a therapist, an ACTUAL therapist not a guidance counselor who self proclaimed themselves as a therapist. Trust me I had so many issues with one of those and I absolutely know where you were coming from, I‚Äôd get into it but that would only upset me since she was the main reason I got so bad.

Basically, even though we can‚Äôt really do school like regular everyday teens we can still graduate and we get one on one attention to get through our work almost all the time. I wouldn‚Äôt have this luxury if I didn‚Äôt have ocd to the level I have it to where I can not be in a normal classroom without being a distraction because of my anxiety (having panic attack, crying, etc), other people have tried to get into the program and the school just kinda ignored them. Which is just wrong on too many levels.

I feel personally that all students should get an opportunity to have the privileges that I have; one on one help, therapists, specialized schedules, and etc. unfortunately here in America it may never happen ever. Teachers don‚Äôt get paid enough to do their jobs and no one wants to give funding to the schools that need it most and to the kids and teens who are struggling. You don‚Äôt need to be like me to struggle, you don‚Äôt need to feel a certain level of depression or anxiety to struggle. We all struggle in different ways, sometimes even people without any mental illnesses could seriously benefit from more help or from a therapist if they are just not having a good day.

Guidance counselors are NOT therapists or mental health professionals, regardless of their education that is not what they are hired to do anyway. Schools need to stop making them out to be professionals when all or almost all don‚Äôt have the qualifications to be deemed so.

I wish so much that one day it could be a reality that my privileges are something available to all of those that need them. It‚Äôs ridiculous how little we‚Äôve progressed worldwide to help people who are struggling.

I do wish you the best though OP. I‚Äôm really sorry you had to go through that.",2,1558674407.0,t3_bs77u9,False

I am lucky in that I have a deep, spiritual connection with my higher power. Even if I can't feel it sometimes, I've profoundly felt it enough to remember each day that my feelings are not wrong and enough positive steps in a row leads to rewards or even miracles.

Minimizing our most damaging actions and making strides while making special note of what has worked and what hasn't can take you far. Sometimes switching the set of characters and the setting makes this process smoother. 

I was in a homeless shelter for awhile last month and came out of it a little bit better. 

The disconnect between how I feel and how my family treats me is the most frustrating when I am feeling good about myself but all my family sees is the negatives. Like I'm just a list of bad life statistics.

These individuals see themselves as okay and not in need of self improvement so it's easier for them to put all of their problems on a scapegoat. Anyone can be manic when they face stigmatism for years on end.

If comments are anything to go by I have to believe that all platforms are basically the same attitude...and seriously I don‚Äôt understand how ANYONE can use insta everyone is so fake and ridiculous. 

So, solutions (from someone basically hanging on by a thread so- take with a grain of salt, lol!) Block anyone at the first sign of hostility, you don‚Äôt need it and you don‚Äôt have time for it. From what I‚Äôve seen, forums are where it‚Äôs at for community but pick something online where you know full well it‚Äôs a safe space where you CAN vent and be supported, and lean on that as you would a friend! Lately I‚Äôve been pretty terrified of this reality, knowing someone‚Äôs getting sick of you bc you‚Äôre a hot mess and end up being negative/self-indulgent but at the same time you‚Äôre trying to crawl out of the funk so- impasse city. What‚Äôs helped me and it might help you is to keep a journal, I know it sounds so dumb but hear me out- you get to vent allllll your frustrations and so-called ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù phobias and idiosyncrasies and what‚Äôs catching all that flack is an inanimate BOOK, and maybe you yourself; you don‚Äôt have to unload any baggage on anyone else. Just get it OUT. Not to mention, it rly can help clear up some scattered thoughts and feelings you may not know you had...then, with a somewhat clearer head, you can more intelligently articulate your feelings to a loved one without sounding like you‚Äôre just whinging. (Eg, ‚Äòwell I feel like X bc of Y and Z, but I was thinking if I did ABC to try and better myself I‚Äôd actually get some results- what do you think?‚Äô u know, instead of just, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm feeling blank...‚Äô which rly is hard to respond to sometimes, and is a straight-up emotional dump). People will be more inclined to listen if you actually turn it into a feasible conversation, and take up responsibility for your own emotional labor. And you could always just say, hey I‚Äôm feeling like blank today, can I have a [hug/kiss/shoulder to cry on/ear to vent to/cup of coffee lol wtv you need]? I mean clearly idk what kind of relationships you have, but if the rapport is there sometimes it‚Äôs easier to just directly and honestly state what you need, ESP if it‚Äôs something as simple as a hug; the other person will most likely be overjoyed at being able to help you in the moment, even in a small way.

TL;DR- Limit social media/strategically utilize social media; JOURNAL!!, be empathetic toward your loved ones as well as yourself...try and provide them an out in difficult conversations when speaking abt your own struggles (bc yes, sometimes ppl just DONT wanna hear it, they have their own issues and that‚Äôs totally okay!! It doesn‚Äôt mean they hate you or you‚Äôre not important- it takes mental energy and strength to be there for someone else) and don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for help, if you are afraid start by asking in small ways.

Matured depression however, acts as a window of sorts, a barrier between you and everyone else.

While some kids thrive in an online environment, others find it really hard and disorienting. For many of them, the loss of structure is a really big negative, and they use the landmarks during the day (lunch with friends, etc.) to get through. 

My advice is to get really serious about making a schedule (including friend time) and sticking to it no matter what. Your friends are probably feeling the same way. Organize them to have virtual lunch together. 

In terms of academics, a number of teachers are organizing virtual office hours. These are totally underused. If you are getting next to nothing out of the online classes, show up to the office hours and go over the stuff there. The one-on-one probably sounds terrible, but the research on ADHD suggests that it is important and works when other stuff does not.

Lastly, one strategy is to simply think like a teacher, and design a better online course yourself. If you take on the burden of having to teach a subject to someone else (looking stuff up on Wikipedia, or Khan Academy, or whatever) you will know the content at the end.

When we're depressed it's quite the accomplishment to take basic hygiene. I have been on and off brushing days, sometimes I forget to take a bath, I've spent months not even looking at my hair (more avoiding mirror than not being able to care) and because of that I've got a dreadlock lol.
Once I even had gengivitis (inflammation with bleeding on the gums) that taught me the importance of once in a while flossing, even you don't brush, lol

As others have said, our emotions are all tied together and when we remove one (due to suffering) we also remove the good ones. Without the negative emotions we remove the gauge to show us where the good emotions lie. The numbness allows us to rest and although you shouldn't try to stay there forever it can be a good defense mechanism for a time being.

Personally, I become numb when I'm missing intimacy and love from my life. The fear of feeling immense sadness with no one around to help makes me turn everything off. Finding love can be a 'home base' that allows you to address the bad emotions so you can allow the good ones back in too.

1ixnib3,meo7tlo,PeachRangz,"Hello, sweets. This is a bonafide trauma response. The ways in which our memories encode during moments of extreme duress is significantly different than how they do passively throughout life. The experience of ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù, despite showering is a sensation that prevails **so** many case studies concerning the effects of trauma.

That is all to say that your experience sounds horrendous, and that there is a community of people who have had experiences running parallel to yours, independent of the preceding event in question. Therapy sooner, rather than later, is urgent. But I would implore you to be very selective over your therapist.

If you have insurance, there are often website portals, that offer therapists according to specialty, with pictures (sometimes with introductory videos). Really getting a feel for who you want to see will go **miles** towards sorting through how you‚Äôre feeling.

Beyond this, assigning words to the sensations/feelings your experiencing yields remarkably promises results in those who might often be contending with extreme events (such as the one you described). A trained therapist will help you to find the verbiage to understand what you‚Äôre feeling whilst your brain is playing catchup.

You need not wait for a therapist to begin writing about the feelings when they arise. Label a thought as a ‚Äúthought‚Äù. Label a feeling as a ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù, a memory as a ‚Äúmemory‚Äù. If you‚Äôre able to sit with a large sheet of blank paper and just write, stream of consciousness, it might help to ground you quite a bit, and attune you to your surroundings. This is, naturally, if you feel able to probe the feelings.

If not, my utmost recommendation would be to sit with someone you vibe with, preferably with clinical training. My deepest and most sincere condolences to you. I will be praying for your friend, and am hoping you can update with some positive news soon!

You absolutely did the right thing by getting her medical help. She's in the best place possible for the immediate issue(s), and also got it any weird complications crop up. Be patient. Be gentle with yourself. You were on a massive adrenaline high so it'll take a while to completely wind down. This probably feels like the last thing you want to do when you're worried, but try to pamper yourself a little. Get some cosy blankets, put on a soft movie, eat something that brings you comfort. If possible, get a friend to come keep you company.

For the whole of your family, it's not bad to move on from the accident because that shows how much you care and love for your niece. To show that you really care and want to help, you can support suicide prevention charities and do various events for them. 

Your niece sounds like a wonderful person and I am so sorry this has happened but just know she didn't mean to effect you and was overcome with emotions. From experience, I wasn't able to speak my mind because I was scared what people would think and puberty plays a huge role in this because it muddles up all your emotions. I don't mean to be rude but.. it's not bad she committed suicide because she showed you that you need to always be supportive, aware and loving. If anything, she showed you that you should always tell others your feelings to help yourself and others around you.

clgnjp,evvsvgo,sapataodebotinha,"thank you so much for sharing, I relate to this feeling of never ending pain so deeply...

when I was 13 a close friend killed herself and everyone was hurt, but unfortunately the adults dealt with her death the worst way possible: with denial. in the beginning they told us lie after lie - she‚Äôs traveling, she moved to another city - and all this time I could tell something about their explanation was off...

but when her parents scheduled her burial and the truth was out, my child brain simply couldn‚Äôt deal with this and shut down... i spent the following 10 years without even remembering that ever happened, until i was 23 and someone else i knew killed themselves too, so the memories came back rushing in and it was HORRIBLE, I swear I don‚Äôt know how i managed to stay alive after this hidden truth hit me so hard, it was running in the back of my head for all these years, but i just couldn‚Äôt remember, and when i finally did, i felt so guilty for not saying goodbye to my friend, so guilty for not remembering her, so guilty and extremely sad...

I really wish the adults had taken different decisions back then, because trying to hide it caused the worst possible consequences... if i could turn back time i would make my parents and every other adult involved put me and all the kids in therapy so that we could talk about what happened and understand what it meant, understand in our own words, us kids could have grieved her death together and relied on each other to overcome this tragedy and say our proper goodbyes and try to move on...

that would have been much better than having to deal with it by myself 10 years later without even understanding where that feeling was coming from, drowning in guilt and self-hatred. therapy and meds saved my life in these last few years, and i thought maybe if i share my story this process doesn‚Äôt have to be so hard for other kids out there who unfortunately are going through something similar",3,1564846494.0,t3_clgnjp,False

v4d0v9,ib40969,SurvivorOfLife5,"Just something to think of and offer a few different perspectives. Firstly before I share the perspectives that man loves you what a beautifully yet sad thing to say. Incredibly real raw and honest which is a huge step to open up and share that. I too have said something similar to my partner he is my rock and I'd be lost without him. 

OK here are the food for thought perspectives:

1. When a person is depressed they feel whole body depressed. Depressed people are highly intuitive they are very careful to hold their true feelings and depression in because living it feels like shit. The last thing they want is to make others feel yuck or bring anyone down to feel like they do. They don't want anyone to suffer what they are suffering so they put on a mask and try so hard to make out everything is OK even though clearly things aren't OK. He may feel like he is protecting you from his pain. He needs to know that whatever he shares with you, You can handle and that you won't think any less of him or excessively worry. Something like "" hey babe when you said you'd die for me etc it made me feel so special I'm not stressing about it I'm handling what you said and don't want you to worry about me because I'm OK. Do you think you should speak to a psychologist to help you understand why you feel the way you do. I know you feel horrible and if there is a chance it might help wouldn't it be worth it. It must feel awful feeling how you do. I want to support you however I can but I'm not trained but I will always listen to you and I'll never tell you how your feeling is wrong. I might not understand why you feel the way you do that's what a psychologists job is and if you get help you can tell me so I can better understand too. Iam always here for you no matter what ""

2. Growing up he may have not witnessed his parents talking about there feelings. His parents may not have taught him how to express his feelings or articulate & understand why he feels the way he does. It's no one's fault it's past generations and slowly then generational pattern of not talking about feeling is changing but it takes time. The only way to get the right words to articulate and understand how you feel if your confused is to see a psychologist they will help you understand. A person is never depressed for no reason there is always something going on deep inside but if they've not learnt how to understand there feelings they'll feel confused, overwhelmed, heavy, tired and like they can't go on and things are too much. He needs to work through things to help him heal whatever wound he needs to heal. It takes time you need to see a psychologist every 2 weeks for a minimum of 3 months to peel back the layers. Sometimes depression is our natural way to protect ourselves from feeling or seeing things that are bubbling under the surface which might be too painful to see and feel. Shame is a hard feeling to embrace and usually we all try to not feel it. Honestly the only way to heal it is to feel it but it needs to be done with the support of family/friends and a psychologist. Name the feeling to tame it and understand it.

Just a few thoughts from me. Medication is great but it's really just a bandaid but if he wants to take medication to help him through then that's OK too. What he can't do is suffer anymore  of have this go on for too long. At the end of the day it's his choice what he wants to do.

Take care of you too and if you get stuck on how to help him speak to a councellor yourself. They will have heaps of advice for you.

As for fixing his depression? Meds and therapy can help but realistically you can't force someone to treat a problem they have.

I also cannot stress ‚Äúsoul searching trips‚Äù enough. Certainly with COVID it might be tough to pack up and go somewhere for a few days, but maybe that is what you need.

lbsf28,glwwu5f,AshOrMania,"I don't have a specific plan of action for you, obviously, but I just want to pull a few things out of your post and reframe/normalize them a little bit.

> At the point now where I‚Äôm too anxious to take anxiety medication because I‚Äôm anxious to get side effects

This is normal, not backwards! A lot of people with anxiety or anxiety symptoms are highly sensitive to their bodies and any changes that occur within them. 

>I‚Äôve seen a therapist before but not for awhile. I always felt like I was bothering them.

Lots of people feel this way too but in this case, it sounds like these feelings might be part of a pattern where you minimize your feelings and needs. You're definitely not bothering a therapist (if a therapist acts like you are, they're not good at their job and you should get a new one). Your post is full of phrases indicating that you are sort of shaming yourself for feeling this way, and you're expecting a therapist to tell you to get over it. It sounds like other people in your life have reinforced this as well, which is shitty and wrong. You deserve to address what you're going through and to feel better! Any therapist and anyone who values you would agree. Your kids need a mom who loves herself and knows her own value and the importance of honoring her own feelings as well.

> But I feel strange for being like this because I am 33, I‚Äôm married, have three kids, a house, a job, a nice large family, lots of friends and cousins and a dog etc and there‚Äôs no issues... 

First of all, your life situation doesn't need to merit how you're feeling. You don't need to ""earn"" whatever mental health symptoms you're going through. That's just not how it works. That's why they have Michael Phelps on those Talkspace commercials! He won a bazillion Olympic gold medals and he's married to a model and he's depressed. That's just how it works! 

HOWEVER you did go through something. Your kid is fine and happy and healthy now (yay!) but omg babies, and your OWN baby, holy shit, you experienced this huge jarring, life-altering situation where your baby came out with something ""wrong"" and that opened your eyes to the fact that a whole world full of possibilities beyond your control could happen at any time. What a huge thing to happen at an incredibly vulnerable time in your life, and it didn't even happen only to you, it happened to your baby! The person you feel so protective of, at the most vulnerable time. And it affected you financially, it took away from your maternity leave, I'm sure it impacted other things. No wonder you got freaked the hell out and still haven't recovered. Sure, yes, having a club foot is no big deal medically in a sense, and your kid is fine, but that's not the point. Your brain isn't concerned with that. Your brain is concerned with possibilities (omg so many) and what's within your control (omg not much) and your radar has been on overload since you experienced this very real incident.

People who don't get it, won't get it, but that doesn't mean you're being dramatic and whiny. It means you've been through something and it's affected you deeply. Your best bet now is to find a therapist, preferably one who specializes in anxiety disorders or trauma, and explain the situation. The goal isn't to learn that you're being dramatic and to stop, the goal is to understand how to modulate your responses so you can cope in your daily life. It's not about getting over it, it's about learning how to incorporate what happened and how you feel about it into healthier responses now. 

The first major part of this is to honor what you went through though. Your reactions make sense, they're just keyed up to the point where they're interfering with your life now. Therapy can help turn the volume down. You're not wrong to worry about things, that's normal, but you don't need that worry to escalate beyond your ability to manage it healthily. You're also showing your kids by example that their feelings matter, even if they're a little over the top, and they deserve to have them be taken seriously, and that if they're too much sometimes, it's okay to find someone to help.

Best of luck!!",33,1612389036.0,t3_lbsf28,False
lbsf28,glwkzer,Cautious_Clementine,"Hi. I‚Äôm not a professional. But it very well could be PTSD. There are some really good treatments for that- that aren‚Äôt drugs, but you would need to see a therapist to work through them. See if you can find someone you don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre bothering, or try the app betterhealth. You can zoom people for pretty good prices. I was super pleased with it. 

The other thing I wanted to say is what you actually do, matters more than what you think. Granted what you think *can* and does sometimes shape what you do, but the two are not mutually exclusive, thank god. There‚Äôs this concept called ‚ÄúThe call of the void‚Äù ? I think I remember from my therapy- Perfectly happy healthy people have it when they stand near an edge, and it comes in the form of them jumping off or falling, etc... the purpose of which is that when your brain recognizes a danger, this ‚Äúcall‚Äù helps activate adrenaline to aid you in being more careful. It may be activating at perceived threats, rather than actual ones. Wanting an escape, even a permanent escape is not bad, either? In my experience, it‚Äôs usually a cry for help when you feel completely trapped. As long as it doesn‚Äôt actually compel you to do harm, these are not altogether weird or uncommon experiences to have together? Especially if you‚Äôve been going for a really long time... And I hope you don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm making light of your circumstance. I absolutely hate to assume things- this is just from what I understand and from my experiences only. Again, not a professional, and not suggesting any forms of treatment- except that it‚Äôs totally a thing with PTSD and can be treated without drugs. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs what it is exactly? I have personally been diagnosed with PTSD, so what I have and what you are describing may not be the same thing. But a professional for PTSD may actually really be able to help you out. I wish you the best of luck, and if nothing else hope you feel like a very good, very loving, diligent momma who deserves some peace.",8,1612384179.0,t3_lbsf28,False

2) psilocybin mushrooms (only needed to do it once and the positive effects lasted for years....basically made new neuronal connections, changed the way i thought and talked to myself, they acted kinda like a reset button for the brain).

You can change that with mindfulness/acceptance exercises. They are painful in the short term, but progressively, they will provide more and more relief and reduce more and more the negative affect.

You can under the supervision of a registered therapist make the following type of exercise, and variations of it; you will imagine yourself watching the video in the present (and not in the past) with reduced detail; as you imagine it, you will simultaneously imagine yourself being indifferent to the video, like a rock. No judgement, no disdain, no pain, no pleasure, just neutral indifference.

dsp7bk,f6regjx,None,"Take it from me man. People who know me, like *really know me*, know that I‚Äôm nothing but a bottle of rage and hatred. I‚Äôve been dealing with it for a long time now. Turning it inward doesn‚Äôt make it go away, it only makes it worse. And turning it outward at someone or something else may make it feel better for a moment, oh it makes it feel soooo much better. But only for a moment. Then you feel horrible, then the consequences come, then you feel worse, then you‚Äôre stuck with your anger and hatred and bitterness, but have another problem added to it. 

Trust me. When I was younger (I‚Äôm still not old) I would go out with friends and get wasted, do drugs, haha it‚Äôs all fun and games haha, until I get a little too drunk and a little too high. And my inhibitions go a little too low. And that mouthy prick who‚Äôs been getting on my nerves all night gets a little too close. Then it ends with me bloodying up some poor fool (who probably had it coming) while out for a cigarette, and what do I get out of it? My friends won‚Äôt talk to me for days, they‚Äôre weary on taking me out anywhere because the first drunken idiot to stumble in my path will face my wrath. At best your night is over, you go home with a bloody face and a shitty feeling in your gut. and at worse you get charged, cuffed, and hauled off to jail for seriously hurting another person. 

Go get help. Go talk to someone. I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm ‚Äúcured‚Äù, or that I don‚Äôt still have violence and hatred deep inside of me. But what I have learned is that when it takes hold, when it makes you want to snap, you just let it go. You breathe and you let it go and when the moment passes you‚Äôll feel better about it. Much better. 

Take it from me. I‚Äôve put my fists and head through walls, I‚Äôve beaten people up for ‚Äúcrossing‚Äù me in some way (some deserved it some didn‚Äôt), I‚Äôve taken it out on people who love me by being emotionally abusive, and I‚Äôve felt so much remorse, shame, guilt, hurt, sorrow afterward that all I wanted to do was off myself. 

Don‚Äôt let yourself get this far gone man. It‚Äôs a miracle that; A) I‚Äôm not in prison. B) I don‚Äôt have a criminal record. C) I haven‚Äôt hurt myself *too badly* and D) I‚Äôm still alive to tell you this story today. 

I reached out and got help, although minimal as it was. I got just enough to get my head on straight, get some sedatives to tame the beast inside of me, and I have at least a short term plan in place. It doesn‚Äôt have to be a mental hospital for you, it doesn‚Äôt have to be prison, it doesn‚Äôt have to be any of those things. Go talk to a counsellor or a therapist or whatever and just fucking VENT. That‚Äôs how my first counselling session went. I just vented on my counsellor. Afterward I developed a very close bond with her, she‚Äôs a beautiful woman (inside and out) and she‚Äôs helped me through so much. Reach out my man. It‚Äôs never too late. Go talk to someone before you get yourself into trouble, or get yourself hurt, or have to learn the hard way from taking a few good beatings and spending a few nights in cuffs behind bars in the drunk tank.

A really helpful thing a therapist once told me is (paraphrasing) ""your thoughts don't make up who you are, and you can't ever prevent a thought from happening. You can try to shoo away the thought or counter it, but brains just do things, sometimes it's us thinking, but sometimes it's just a thought. What makes you yourself is what you believe, your actions, how you treat others, and what you want to do with your life.""

I used to be so terrified I was a bad person because of the intrusive thoughts I would get, and when you work to suppress a thought or idea, it only makes it bounce back harder. One day I finally had to accept that even if the thoughts were mine, even if that made me by default a bad person, that it didn't matter. I took it's power over me away by realizing the power to decide who I am and whether I'm a good person, is exclusively in my choices, and the values that I choose to hold.",79,1590863534.0,t3_gtinqb,False

But it's important to remember that everyone has mental health and that anyone can suffer from mental health conditions at anytime. In many ways the very fact people are sharing awareness and that our language is evolving is a positive.
They might not be fully on board yet and they may not fully understand it. But it's a start.
These same people could well find themselves struggling with an episode in the future, and they themselves will have a better understanding from there.

But if them sharing information and opening up the discussion helps one or two people to reach out and get support then whether they are doing it for their own satisfaction or not, they would have still done some good.

I would love for people who share awareness to be fully behind the messages they are sharing and for the world to be a kinder place. But all we can do is keep trying to educate. Keep managing our own health and look for people who can support us in that mission.

People will learn as they grow and we can either help them get there or walk away so they don't hurt us in the process. Both are valid responses and both are important.

Its like telling someone to stop, drop and roll when they are on fire and you are standing next to a bucket of water...metaphorically speaking.

Funny thing is, that fairly screwed up childhood, for all the damage it has continued to do in my life, has actually made me into a person I am actually quite proud of. So much of who I am, or rather who I am trying to become, is in direct response to the things about my upbringing that I have recognized were unhealthy and toxic.

You've internalized your mother's, er, tactlessness and lack of empathy. You're self-punishing, but she isn't showing appreciation for that. The logical conclusion of that journey is for you to commit punitive suicide.

If you'll forgive my candor, I should like to reassure you that *pain is pain*. You're miserable, you're being mistreated, and the plight of some other person in some other country isn't strictly relevant to your life, any more than your suffering is relevant to theirs. As soon as you're living in a healthy environment, surrounded by people who respect you, then perhaps you can spare the emotional energy to fight for the rights of others. Right now, it's OK to focus on taking care of yourself. It isn't selfish. It's *self-care.* If you don't do it, who will?

You're allowed to feel guilty for wanting to take care of yourself or for being unhappy with your life. That's OK. You don't have to apologize to anyone else for how you feel. We may be judged by our actions, but our feelings are our own business, and if someone told you that you have to justify what goes on inside your own head, they lied to you.

Why do you feel shitty? You feel shitty because your mother is being shitty.

Why do you feel guilty about feeling shitty? It's because she taught you that your feelings don't matter.

Why do you find it hard to avoid spiraling? It's because your support system isn't living with you, whereas your toxic mother *is*.

For my part, I know I don't want to die, I just want a way out of my suffering. But I'm not ready to give up striving for the hope of a better existance. I hope you aren't either.

Here's my totally unqualified take: If it's something that's bothering you so much you even once think of suicide, you're not overeacting. You shouldn't be treated badly. I know how you feel about it being your mom. Mine also does some pretty similar stuff, but in her mind, she is always in the right. It's just how she is, just how she sees the world, I'm don't even think she's so incredibly hurtful to be malicious, just careless. 

So my advice would be distance. Emotionally, for now (but hopefully physically later). Don't let her get to you anymore. Don't talk to her about subjects that are really important to you that she might put down. Don't tell her about your hopes and dreams, cause that shit is fragile. Treat her like the careless woman she is, don't let her hold anything as precious as your mental state. But find someone else to talk to about that stuff.

Are you in therapy? If you aren't, I would really recommend it (if you can!). It would probably really help figure out some ways to manage your feelings and problems in a constructive way. You could also do a therapy meeting with your therapist and your mom and try and talk through stuff.

t8o6os,hzq18ap,gramercygremlin,"We use words like 'strong' and 'weak' so regularly that it's easy to think we all mean the same thing by them. But a strong cup of coffee, the world's strongest man competition winner, a strong drink, and a strong move to the basket are all different uses of the term. 

When I was as kid, I almost drowned in a lake. I was terrified of pools and lakes after that. But I wanted to go to a pool party because I liked a girl and didn't want to be looked down upon. Facing my fear was strong.

I have a friend who is an alcoholic.  Despite the trouble alcohol has given them in their life, they still often really want a drink. Being able to resist an intense urge, be it unconscious or an addiction, is strong.

&#x200B;

In your case - you're terrified of other people. Yet you interact with people. Sometimes passively, sometimes angrily. But you interact. The reason is because you are human and we are social creatures. You're stuck in a war between the part of you that is in terror and the part of you that wants to connect with other people. The healthier choice is to connect, so every time you choose to interact, even if angrily, is an attempt to be healthy.

Part of your mind is in such turmoil that it believes suicide would be useful. But another part of your mind is saying no, I won't go for that. It knows the cost/benefit analysis is skewed and won't let you fall for the suicide story. That is healthy. That is strong.

That said, if you don't want to use the word 'strong' for someone who faces their terror, who struggles to somehow try to interact with others, and who does not accept a tempting resolution because they know deep down it is a mirage, that's fine. Find another word. But what ever you call it, a spade is a spade.",5,1646672252.0,t3_t8o6os,False

My advice for everyone here, is to spend lesser time on social media because it will drain you, and make you feel like you haven't accomplished anything, because you see your mates doing big things, life is not a race, but a journey.

One thing that has always comforted me (and I hope will comfort you) is a saying my father always used to say to me; whenever I got caught up worrying about the future or running out of time, my father would always turn to me and say this: ""Life is like a river, and it's gonna take you wherever the current wants to go. You can try and push against that current for your whole life, or you can try and go with the flow."" My point with this (and I think his point, too) is that while time is indeed finite and our lives won't last forever, we shouldn't spend our time worrying about what to do with it. 

Focus on what is good in your life at this moment. Don't think about ""what if"" -- think about ""what *is*."" Take life one step at a time or you're going to keep feeling overwhelmed about the future. Focus on a single next step you can take -- don't obsess over what comes down the line.

I think there is a lot of pressure for your 20s to be Wild and Exciting and Full Of Adventure. For some it is, but that's usually propped up by an insane amount of privilege and flashed about on social media. A lot of people in their 20s fumble and struggle to establish themselves (job, romantic and social life, economically) or even just to get by, but you rarely see or hear about that.

2020 kicked a lot of people's butts. Give yourself some grace and the permission to not have things figured out, to just get by (getting by is very underrated) until you're in a position, mentally and practically, to make the big changes you want. Let yourself feel lost for a while. You will get back on track. Don't spread yourself too thin; work out what's the most important thing to keep you going for now and focus on that.

Edit: I forgot to add one more thing that helps me lots. When bad thoughts pop up, it‚Äôs likely not your fault.

I started to realize how much I ran my mouth and how harsh my words sounded. It took me a lot of self control to stop casually roasting people. But guess what? After a lot of practice, it does get a lot easier.

Take the time to compliment yourself and others. If someone‚Äôs hair or clothes or shoes looks good, tell them, or if the moment isn‚Äôt right, store the conscious thought in your brain. It helps to take note of the positive stuff around you. Also another habit I groomed myself into: saying please and thank you.

But now that you *do* know, try to catch yourself when you do these things. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up over it. Make a mental note of it, apologize if you‚Äôre being a dick to someone, adjust the behavior, and continue talking.

Another good thing to do is ask friends to hold you accountable. If you‚Äôre close with people, tell them that you know you have an issue with negativity and sometimes meanness, and ask them to nicely point out when you‚Äôre being negative and/or mean for attention or for no reason. When they call you out, remember that they‚Äôre doing it from a place of love and support, and that you told them to do it. Thank them, and then adjust your behavior in the moment.

And please don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre just the only one who‚Äôs done this, or that it makes you a bad person. I have done (and still occasionally do) this type of thing. It kinda comes with the territory. Mental illness isn‚Äôt necessarily recognized if it‚Äôs not performed in some way. That‚Äôs why things like depression, anxiety, ADHD, and OCD are called ‚Äúfake‚Äù more often than psychosis, schizophrenia, and the like. So because we don‚Äôt get as much help or attention when we *seem* like we‚Äôre okay, and there‚Äôs a stigma around asking people for help (and a fear that we‚Äôll be rejected because people don‚Äôt always believe us), we default to negativity. We get sad and pessimistic, partially because that can be our worldview, and partially because people can see when we‚Äôre outwardly sad, and will give us attention. Meanness is a thing that can happen, especially when you don‚Äôt necessarily read social cues very well. And even when we can, there might be a part of us that *wants* to push people away, specifically because we think we‚Äôre broken people who make others‚Äô lives worse by proxy. So when people are nice to us, we sometimes try to drive them away.

None of this is wrong or bad. It‚Äôs something that should be worked on and improved, and hopefully overcome, but it doesn‚Äôt make you an incorrect or bad person.",5,1601920795.0,t3_j5jc15,False

I used to work with a guy that loved and collected lawn mowers. You couldn't pay me to mow a lawn, lol. However, he loved talking about them. So, I would listen and try to figure out what he liked about it. I never got ""honest"" and told him I thought it was odd. 

He told me I was the only person to ever listen to him about it.

Be like that. 

Meanwhile, I know people with massively dysfunctional relationships and drug problems. Depending on the situation, I will either listen and express concern, or I will be more honest about my fears, etc. For me, if I'm ""nice"" to a person walking on the edge of death, I am part of the problem.

Mostly though, I just try to be there for people and try to enjoy them. 

I have gotten a lot of benefit over the years from this and I didn't even know I was doing anything. As an example, years ago, I used to love going to the movies with my one friend.

qr2vxz,hk563w9,Snowstorm_81,"Having suffered from depression for 20years, hopefully I can shed some light on this concept.

When i was much younger, i used to have exactly the same feeling as the OP.  But i would also hide it a lot because I would experience so many others who pretended to be depressed to get attention and sympathy but would be gossiped about and clear it was attention seeking. In my eyes these a days, this is a huge contributory factor on the stigma surrounding depression. 

As I've got older and really trying to understand the stigma, I've come to understand something very important. Those who have never truly had depression or even a depressive spell simply cannot understand what it is or how it feels. So this then creates a few outcomes. 1) they are close-minded and don't want to hear about it. 2) SOME had a brief period of feeling down, so think you should just get over it. 3) they care about you but have no idea how to help, so try to avoid talking about it. 4) they truly care and learn about it by researching and asking about it and try to understand. 5)the sufferer hides it so well that only fellow sufferers can spot the signs

It's an extremely complex topic but ultimately, those who don't have chronic depression will never truly understand it and everyone else will habe varying degrees of tolerance. These days, I understand that everyone is different and quite simply, as I've got older, I have no interest in having a large friendship circle. As you mature, you will realise having a small very close circle where you can be yourself is far far superior to having a huge circle where you have to act a certain way depending on the company at that moment. 

Mental Health Awareness has a long way to go before the stigma is gone. There are many factors contributing to it persisting unfortunately. It will take time for the general population to be able to understand and see past the stigma

For me personally, I can spot it a mile away if someone is depressed. There are certain red flags that show a change in character when that mindset sets in. Unfortunately, not enough people know how to spot them for many of the reasons mentioned above.",28,1636592218.0,t3_qr2vxz,False

It seems they cared about you enough to seek a professional diagnosis and treatment. A lot of kids grow up with parents neglecting their physical health, let along their emotional health. They maybe spent a lot of time talking about their fears with the professionals who diagnosed you. I don't think this has been easy on them either.

Having ""the talk"" is potentially something they agonised about for a long time.

Obviously it hurts to find out something other people knew before you knew yourself, and maybe they could have been more open, but I don't believe the right approach is to write them off as being bad parents.

Everyone has reasons for lying, and it's not always with bad intent, even though it can feel horrible if you learn the truth. Maybe they hoped to avoid making you feel different, and wanted to give you as many years as they could without you having the added pressure of feeling ""different"".

My mother had serious issues but she tried to hide them, as how she was raised was that mental health issues were shameful and a sign that you're basically defective. She'd say she was going to the dermatologist rather than the psychiatrist, for example. She'd spend days at a time in her room refusing to come out, and my sisters and I thought that it was because we were bad kids. She never explained anything. 

After my first suicide attempt they got me into a counselor but it was still a big dirty secret. When I had my kids I made a conscious decision that they would never feel what I felt. There's a very good chance one of my kids will have issues so I want to make sure they understand mental health as soon as possible.

From the time they were small I explained that the human brain is like a factory that makes really important chemicals called neurotransmitters that are necessary for your mind and body to work. And in most people, the factory works just right - the workers show up for work, the machinery is in good condition, the ingredients for the chemicals are good quality. But in some people, the factory doesn't work right. Sometimes the employees don't show up, the machinery is old and slow, or the chemicals don't get the right ingredients. That makes the neurotransmitters come out too slowly, or too few, or wrong. So in those cases the factory needs help, and the machines need help working, so we bring in the helpers (medications) to fix and maintain the machines so they can work correctly. Sometimes the workers need some more training (therapy,) to do their jobs better.  It's not the factory's fault it was built that way. In the case of bipolar disorder, sometimes the factory slams to a halt and none of the workers show up so nothing works. Sometimes the factory machinery goes haywire, the chemicals are spilling out everywhere, and all of the workers are running around with their hair on fire. In those cases more helpers are needed (emergency meds like Xanax for example). It's not the factory's fault, or the fault of the country that owns the factory (the rest of the body). It just happens sometimes, and when you've got several factories built by the same architect (family genetics), you see the same problems.

Then if they asked about actual diagnosis, or needed more information, I'd tell them it was schizophrenia and try to find a way to explain it that made sense to the child. I would adapt the explanation based on the individual child, but a general explanation might mention major symptoms the child has, and then explain how they are symptoms that people with schizophrenia have, and that's how the doctor knows you have schizophrenia. Then to make it easier to understand, I might compare that to how if you sneeze and cough those are symptoms people with a cold have and that's how the doctor knows you have a cold.

The important thing for me was to *choose* who I wanted to be friends with.

I have only ever felt like I fit in twice in my life: once when I was 15 and went to Whale Camp (marine biology/ecology camp filled with nerds) and in the national co-Ed honors frat Phi Sigma Pi (also a bunch of nerds lol). I‚Äôve thought about this a lot and here are some theories:

a) I grew up with two narcissistic parents and I think I missed some shit growing up, particularly reading non-verbal body language. Time and again, someone gets upset with me for not picking up on something. I‚Äôve tried very hard to communicate this verbally; if there‚Äôs a problem‚Äîplease TELL ME. People don‚Äôt, though, and then I seem like an asshole for missing it. 

b) on a similar note, because my family was so narcissistic, it was *always* a fight to get attention. I had to jump in where I could, otherwise I‚Äôd get nothing. Unfortunately, that habit has stuck with me into adulthood, where it is wholly inappropriate to jump into someone else‚Äôs statement while they‚Äôre talking. I try really hard not to do it, but old habits run deep. I also have Tourette‚Äôs Syndrome and sometimes things just come out of my mouth before I‚Äôve had a chance to think them over. 

c) I‚Äôm a very honest person. I am the world‚Äôs worst liar/bullshitter, and I truly believe this makes a lot of people uncomfortable. Like, no, if your baby isn‚Äôt cute, I‚Äôm not gonna lie and say it is. People don‚Äôt like that shit.",7,1593812079.0,t3_hkmoaa,False

c3ssui,ert4vox,cestmoiparfait,"Manic pixie dream girls describe characters in movies and books who are not well-written -- they aren't real people nor are they written as real people.  Maybe the delusional writer thinks they are, but they aren't.

The expression should be used to discuss a fictional trope.

It's not a trivialization of mental illness and does not describe mental illness.

""In 2005 film critic Nathan Rabin coined the term ""manic pixie dream girl.""¬†Manic pixie dream¬†girls were fictional characters who ""exist solely in the fevered imaginations of sensitive writer-directors to teach broodingly soulful young men to embrace life and its infinite mysteries and adventures.""",100,1561232511.0,t3_c3ssui,False
c3ssui,ertzbro,elisekatrinaa,"I also want to add that ""mania"" is not necessarily the right word in ""manic pixie dream girl.""

I am bipolar and my manic episodes tend to include things that seem relatively normal. I spread myself too thin and take on a lot more than I can handle when I'm depressed because I get an inflated self-esteem, like trying to work too many gigs, see friends all the time, or signing up for more classes than I can actually keep up with. I get really bad insomnia and I jump from one task to another without a lot of planning. I do a lot of things I can't do while depressed in a frenzied way, like cleaning. I sometimes get emotional or angry more quickly due to my unnaturally high energy levels and the need for that energy to be released. I also spend a lot more money because I think less about the repercussions. But overall, to the naked eye it seems like really normal behavior. 

It causes a lot of destruction in the sense that when the episode is over a lot of things shift to the other end of the spectrum, so I have to flake out or quit on a lot of the commitments I made while manic. I have to readjust everything because the decisions I make while manic do not reflect who I am on a normal or low day at all, including trying to rebuild finances that I carelessly spent or suddenly not seeing friends and reverting back to my usually introverted nature. I also often have to apologize for things I said in anger or frustration while I was manic, which can be especially hard when I'm depressed.

But back to the point: ""manic"" is often not displayed through dyed hair, an overly positive attitude, and weird obsessive behaviors. It isn't always quirky and attractive. It's not a realistic or long-term way for a ""male protagonist"" to actually learn anything about ""loving life"" because mania is a spark that dies as quickly as it grew. Mania is sickness. The truth is it looks relatively normal 90% of the time. I never knew women actually described themselves as ""Manic Pixie Dream Girls"" but if that's true then I'm really kinda weirded out by it. Not necessarily offended, but I definitely don't understand why this is a ""dream girl"" stereotype. My boyfriend can 100% attest to it not being a ""dream."" It's a part of me but not something he'd actively sought after in a partner. It has caused many issues in my life and is in no way ""fun"" or an ""ideal.""",13,1561257935.0,t3_c3ssui,False

Hello friend. I don‚Äôt know you but I promise that I care about you, I truly do. From a 25 year old finally finding some stability, here is what I can offer:

YES to therapy. All of it. And not just the stuff that gives you tools on how to manage your depression, but the deep, deep childhood Jungian stuff. If I didn‚Äôt learn why I was how I was, and then go through this year of anger and sadness, and then take the necessary steps to change what I needed to change, I would never get out of the pit. Good therapy is swimming through the river of sh\*t so you can get to the dry bank on the other side.

YES to medication. It‚Äôs a booster, it won‚Äôt change everything. You might have more luck with mood stabilizers instead of anti\-depressants. And, we are currently in an anti\-depressant epidemic, so that always felt a little more comfortable for me. But that is just ego, don‚Äôt let it get to you.

YES to regimented sleep. I mean this. You know the word lunacy or lunatic? It comes from luna, the moon. And it‚Äôs because during full moons when we didn‚Äôt have fully dark homes would keep people up, and it would trigger mania in bipolar. If I sleep 5 hours, I‚Äôm a wreck. If I sleep 9 hours, I‚Äôm a wreck. I need 7\-8 like clockwork, and it seriously takes me from a 2/10 to a 7/10. Do whatever you can to manage this: yellow light glasses, sleeping medication \(stay away from benzo/opioids\), job changes, anything. The studies on this keep on coming.

YES to exercise. It works, it works, it works. Don‚Äôt do sh\*t you hate: if you hate running, lift. If you hate lifting, do yoga. Do it, celebrate every workout, breathe in the endorphin freedom.

YES to finding self responsibility. You will never heal without it. I recently talked to a woman with a 35\-year\-old bipolar son living back at home. I told her, ‚ÄúSorry mom. I know you want to love him, and I know he is in pain, but he will never heal if he is still under mom‚Äôs roof.‚Äù It‚Äôs just how male psychology works. I know you are female, but there are equivalents to this; such as you saying losing your partner would be the end of it. I am absolutely in LOVE with my current partner. I feel the same way. But technically, I do not NEED her. She doesn‚Äôt feed me, or pay my bills, or organize my hiking trips \(now if I didn‚Äôt have those, that‚Äôs another story‚Ä¶\). So you must find self\-reliance. You can, and you will.

YES to long term goals and short term habits. This is called Kaizen. Your small victories are not working because they aren‚Äôt going anywhere. I know we are told to celebrate the showers and the little stuff, and sometimes that helps, but you need to celebrate the showers because that means you are one step closer to X. Being self\-reliant. Volunteering for a cause. Travelling. Getting in great shape. Start with your values, create a self\-mission statement, set five year goals, and break those all the way down to literally what you have to do TODAY to reach it. Write one sentence of a book. Do one pushup. Now these things have meaning.

YES to sobriety. I don‚Äôt drink or smoke and I‚Äôm very bored and it sucks. But I am stable. And I don‚Äôt have breakdowns. And I don‚Äôt have binges. And it is so, so much better. You‚Äôll find a whole new world of health and friendships to explore.

Do not flail your fists violently at depression. It is a fog, it cannot be beat that way. You must be calm, collected, slow and steady. You must wake up to good music, cook a good breakfast, get out the door. Get out the door, every single day. Go to a coffee shop and read, whatever.

You must confront your ineffective thoughts with questions. Not ‚ÄúI‚Äôm NOT a terrible person!‚Äù but, ‚ÄúOK, sure brain, I‚Äôm a terrible person. Here, I‚Äôm going to get up right now and knock this person‚Äôs coffee out of their hand because I‚Äôm terrible. Wait, of course I‚Äôm not going to do that. Can I really be terrible? Hm‚Ä¶‚Äù

YES to trusting others. Everything I just said above, depression has given you reasons and excuses why it will not work. I‚Äôve been there. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all great, but‚Ä¶‚Äù You are in the fog so you can‚Äôt SEE. We can see you, though. I can see you be happy, healthy, stable, strong. I can see you get down like we all do, but knowing  how to manage it correctly and knowing it will end. Be well, I am here.",9,1526053047.0,t3_8ij9gl,False

Music. If you wanna overscream the voices in your head this quiet 3BPM won't help even a bit. You can put (through the music) some other topics in your head, but has to at least as serious/complicated as the mental issues. Or you can empathize through it, sometimes helps that you know you are not alone and you are not wrong/failure/the one to blame etc. Or you can overscream it. Metal is the best for this (combination of everything above or even more). For sleeping is best Melo or Prog death metal/Deathcore.

The ""teleport"" is just a joke I presume.

Those quotes aren't really useful. It's empty words. Put there something more philosophical that make people think, that give them rational hope.

If you want the app to be good you have to put more content into it, so everyone can find something there. And ask someone who is fighting what would help, 'cause if you haven't been there, you can't understand it or even imagine it, so you can't help properly/effectively.

You will never recover from depression through avoidance and self-isolation, these only fuel it long term. The same applies to rumination.

1acqqgq,kjwzfxc,Hexent_Armana,"I feel ya and have the same issue.

I'm pretty sure its depression. A lot of people think depression is all about hating oneself but depression takes many forms. I suspect the form ours takes is stagnation.

I believe for me at least its caused by both my environment and my difficulty ""getting the ball rolling"". My job sucks. Its a dead end, underpays, and I literally can't afford to leave thanks to living in staff accommodation. There is no meaningful reward for working there and no noticeable results from the work I do. This leads to burnout. It doesn't help either that I live with filthy strangers and that my rented room is the only sanctuary from all the unhealthy drunken young adults and tourists in town.

All that results in me needing more recreational time just to try to balance out the stress. Usually video games, anime, or porn in bed. Which typically leads to being up later and losing sleep. Which just makes things worse. I tell myself I'll start fixing it all in a day or two when I'm more well rested but the cycle just keeps repeating.

I can't rely on those around me because they usually just end up disappointing me due to their selfishness. Though I am a selfless person giving my time and energy to the selfish will only make things worse.

I think what people in our situation really need to get out of this stagnation is someone like us who will try to help us as we try to help them in return. Like crawling out of a pit together. Or winning the lottery or something so we can easily afford the time, money, and energy to drastically change our lives for the better.

I wish I had a simple solution for you...but I haven't even figured out my own situation. Hopefully we'll get out of these vicious cycles of ours soon. Good luck. :)",13,1706421131.0,t3_1acqqgq,False

It's not as bad as it used to be when I was a cashier (ugh. Opening, closing, opening, closing. Just pick one! I don't want to constantly switch), but I often feel like... this is it. This is life. It's boring.

Sometimes you have to kind of force yourself to do other things, though. Definitely take up a hobby!

Edit: dumb phone posted too early. Hope it didn't sound crass.

If you're on your phone a lot like I am, I recommend two apps: duolingo and Kindle. Even if you're just lying in bed (it's okay. I've been staying in bed until the last possible minute as well), you can make some of that time more valuable. Reading and learning another language are really great, relatively cheap (in the case of duo, free) hobbies to pick up. And fairly low effort. You don't have to dedicate hours a day either.

I think it is a good idea to force yourself to get out of bed for non-work things. Even getting some indoor exercise equipment can help (and it doesn't have to be expensive or take up a lot of room. I have a small exercise bike and a couple of weights). 

What interests you? More introverted stuff like drawing or extroverted stuff like going out (I'm not one myself, so I honestly don't know what they do lol)? It's definitely easier said than done, but I think getting yourself to do something you like at least once a week can be great.

I've been stuck in a rut before and it sucks. I'm stuck in a socializing rut myself. I'm introverted AND have social anxiety, yet I still need some socialization. But I can't bring myself to do it. And since most of my friends are busy when I'm free, I use that as an excuse (if I'm being honest). So I totally get where you're coming from.",7,1706413202.0,t3_1acqqgq,False

I was the most comfortable in ""I'm not able to"". ""I'm able to"" and ""I don't want to"" made everythign hurt after a miute, which was crazy - it was just a meter next to ""I'm not able to""!

If you're able to do something, but you don't want to, it's very difficult to stand up for it. This exercise showed me that a lot of the time when I claimed ""I'm not able to"" it was actually a cop-out to avoid confrontation - and at the same time, I kept myself in the victim role.

What you say is so important, because a lot of the time we confine ourselves to the victim role without realizing it. Not being able to do something means no responsibility. We can always blame someone or something else for the consequences of our actions. Once we realize that, we can start reclaiming our life.",2,1606461133.0,t3_k1ncvz,False

k1ncvz,gdpw3xv,prettyxxreckless,"While I agree with this mentality, I think it can also become a crutch to further growth. Once we experience trauma, the tendency is to diminish ourselves and put others first, then we gain our empowerment back and choose to spend our time on yourselves and no one else to make us feel good.

I think many people can get trapped there. The next step would be to re-introduce responsibility and begin to take on more challenging tasks and learn to balance the responsibilities of adult life (work, school, family, partners, friends, etc) and our own self-care.

Life is full of unfulfilling tasks. Sometimes we don't want to give that presentation at work. But if we don't, we won't get that promotion we've been working hard for. Sometimes we don't want to attend that family function. But if we don't, we will miss out on beautiful memories. Things like that are part of adult life. Obviously if its an abusive-situation that will re-traumatize you, you can peace-out without shame or guilt.

You tried, fair enough, but did you give your child specifically what they needed or what you thought they needed? Providing what they ask for is an entirely different thing, essential at times but not the same. Some parents are in a position to provide more than enough, but sadly don't bother communicating/bonding with the child and take things for granted. Especially if they had a rough upbringing, but did well on their own in adulthood.

I've been through therapy, seen psychiatrists, taken different meds and, although that stopped me from crying everyday, it didn't stop the sadness. Over the last two years I have slowly found myself crawling out, although I've had plenty of back slides. I changed how I ate and have lost 80 pounds, which has helped with my self confidence. I started doing things for just me. I took a trip to the beach for several days, by myself, and it was the best, most relaxing vacation I have ever had. I also started just focusing on the now. What is in front of me? What can I control? Have I put myself in a situation that can cause triggers? Establishing boundaries is extremely important as is fighting the urge to feed that depression. That is the hardest part. You're so much better than depression tells you. I know that dark place and how easy it is to live there. Be your own cheerleader. Congratulate yourself on the smallest task. Be proud of what you can accomplish. That positivity can help boost those positive endorphins we seem to be lacking and help you continue pushing forward.

e44yen,f974r6v,dogsveon,"I was diagnosed with major/clinical depression a couple years before I started high school, and had been experiencing symptoms of it, including suicidal thoughts, self harm urges, and more since I was twelve. I remember my resolution for sixth grade was to die before switching schools. I grew up in a very unhealthy family dynamic, and due to a mix of avoiding telling my parents I didn‚Äôt want to live, neglect, and what I believe was just plain denial, I didn‚Äôt start getting any legitimate treatment until years later. I can definitely relate, and know so many of the thoughts you mentions too, too well. It‚Äôs hard for me to even categorize kids who grew up with depression with adults who develop it later on in life together because there‚Äôs such a huge factor that differentiates between them. When we experienced depression as children, we never experienced life that wasn‚Äôt hidden behind that blue lens, and if we weren‚Äôt aware of it, how were we supposed to differentiate between what‚Äôs trauma induced/chemical imbalance versus the personality traits, preferences, etc. that the kids around us were developing? The big difference between developing the illness as a child versus an adult ‚Äî learning new healthy coping skills versus RE-learning them. Which becomes pretty obvious when talking to someone who grew up like you or me. 
I‚Äôve been seeing a therapist weekly as well as trying several different medications for roughly four or five years now, and in the smoother patches, the one thing that has *truly*  been the barrier that prevents me from healing, that keeps me coming back to this mindset, is the idea that my depression is stitched directly into my personality. In those moments where I actually *wanted* to get better, I still felt that I couldn‚Äôt. I was so afraid that getting better meant leaving the comfort of my ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù and that I‚Äôd no longer know who I was (do I even know now?). Getting better meant starting over from scratch, and I was so used to being who I was with depression, that knowing the only way to do heal was to break away from who I learned to be all my life was the most vulnerable, intimidating, and terrifying journey I could imagine.
I don‚Äôt know what would‚Äôve happened if I stayed in a steady mindset where I wanted to get better but was scared to try, because I‚Äôve since had a full 180 and haven‚Äôt had the desire to help myself since. Hearing that another person experiences the same worries does give me a little hope though. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not alone. You‚Äôre not alone, too. Maybe we can help each other through it.

The one thing I can say for sure is that I have discovered a few new parts of my personality since realizing my depression had masked over most of what I thought it was. It turns out I have a passion for ceramics. I didn‚Äôt know until I blindly picked the clay class my school was offering when trying to drop out of a different class that was causing a lot of anxiety. I ended up discovering that it quieted my mind and helped me cope with my overwhelming stress in high school more than anything else. The class was the practically the only thing that could get me out of bed for more than half my high school experience. So it‚Äôs possible, and it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôll be **nothing** without our illnesses, it just might be really, really fucking daunting to pullback those curtains.",5,1575159311.0,t3_e44yen,False

Sorry, dad.  I'm still broken decades after that letter.  

Even when I don't have symptoms (which isn't very often), I'm still mentally ill.  That's who I am, and who I will always be.  I don't think that's a terrible thing.  I'm pretty fucking awesome.  And I've pulled off some amazing things despite (and because of) my mental illnesses.  

But!  I fight against it every day.  It's come very close to killing me.  I like my life.  I am crazy smart and loved well.  My mental health problems are an inescapable part of my life - and that of those around me.  Thus I consider it to be my job to work at being well.

I'm not trying to change the fact that I am mentally ill.  that's just not going to happen.  But, I sure as shit can have a lot of fun.  And that's what ""changing it"" means to me - the facts stand, but I can squeeze more joy out of my day if I do the shit I need to do.

I don‚Äôt even bother telling people a lot of the time, as I get tired of people comparing my illness to there preference of organising their cupboards, or of being told that I‚Äôm ‚Äúlucky‚Äù as I must be a tidy person (I‚Äôm actually really not lol).

However, I also have a physical, chronic illness that causes daily pain, fatigue, headaches, dizziness, etc. That is a ""real"" physical ailment, not a mental illness, but it is also primarily invisible on the outside, and I get the same treatment for that as well - people not really taking it seriously, brushing it off, etc. So I think it is at least, in part, the fact that it is something that people can't see and therefore can't connect with as easily. For the record, I think this is a shitty excuse. I think having some empathy and compassion can go a long way, and we need to change the perception around both mental and physical invisible illnesses so that this negative judgement happens a lot less.",4,1588788164.0,t3_gek4b1,False

1cjcnhk,l2gw22h,throwaway1792947474,"I'm going to be brutally honest here about something I don't talk about much. 
When I was younger, I was bullied a lot. I had a very tough life at home dealing with abuse, both verbal and physical, seeing abuse between my parents or their significant others. I grew up in a household where I spent my entire childhood playing video games to drown out yelling happening in my house. 
I was constantly in trouble at school, bullied at school, and constantly felt like I was doing something wrong for things I couldn't control. I have ADHD and had it even more severely as a child, and my grades suffered because of it. Eventually, I became very witty. I got good at quick remarks, talking back, hitting people where it hurt when they would say things to me. 
This turned into me being the class clown. I'd do anything to make people laugh. 
Sometimes, it was at the expense of others, whether it be teachers or other students. 
Looking back, I feel horrible about this. I feel appalled and disgusted by my actions and who I was. 
But around when I turned 17, I decided I hated who I was. I was angry all the time, I was mean, I wasn't anywhere near the person that I wanted to be. 
So I decided to change. And I did. I put everything into trying to be better, and part of that came with a deep-rooted hatred for myself. I changed, I was softer, I was less tense, I listened and thought about my responses and still do. But the people that I was mean to never seen me as changed, no matter what I did. It didn't seem to matter how hard I tried, they would still see me as the same person. For a while, this frustrated me, and I didn't understand it. But at some point, I realized that they didn't have to forgive me. They had no obligation to forgive me for how I treated them, so I stopped begging them to forgive me, and I let them feel how they wanted to feel because I felt like if anything, they deserved to be able to choose how they feel about me. 

I don't hold an important job. Right now, I'm actually unemployed and struggling a lot. I'm 23, I live with my mom still and have a long list of diagnoses, including PTSD. I don't have anything figured out in my life yet. But I know I'm a better person. I know that I changed, and I am nowhere near that person that I was when I was younger. 
I'm saying all of this, not to boast, not for congratulations. I wouldn't be upset if people responded to this with saying I'm a horrible person for what I did. 

But I pay for how I treated people when I was younger every day. With severe depression, anxiety, adhd, ptsd, a long list of trauma, and so on. 
I self sabotage a lot because I feel as if I don't deserve to succeed. 

I want to add that none of what I did was physical. It was entirely verbal, but that doesn't make it any better. No matter what anyone says, words hurt, especially if someone knows what words will get under your skin. 

I hope in some way that sharing this with you offers you some insight. I can not speak for someone else, and I don't desire to do so. But if they got a job as a psychologist, I'm going to assume, or I'm going to hope that they went through a period that I did where they looked at themselves introspectively and really decided to change. 

Lastly, you don't have to forgive them. If you believe they don't deserve that forgiveness, then you don't have to give it to them. You are allowed to feel however you wish to feel about what happened when you were a kid that changed who you are, just as anyone else is.

16i1ygl,k0j2uaz,WalkingHazards,"Hey man, I've heard this sentiment for varying reasons over the years and I just wanna let you know a few things. 

First, there's nothing to hate about being a guy. Everyone has struggles, and some are unique to gender, sexuality, identity and whatever else, but it's worth remembering that those struggles don't define you. Be kind, be caring, be understanding and always always hold on to that part of you that is made uncomfortable by these red pilled misogynistic types - it's easy to fall into that trap, but you can't fall for it and from the sounds of things you aren't, I'm proud of you for that. 

Second, I promise there are plenty of people out there around you who are awesome too. It can be rough meeting new people, I know I found it tough, but I assure you if you just show that you're a decent bloke, decent people will come. Be friendly, outgoing, listen to people's interests and show an interest in them and you'll make friends in no time! 

Third, there's nothing more masculine than being a good man. Looking after people, being kind to people and being accepting and welcoming is the most masculine thing you can be, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. If you go to the gym, there's a reason some of the most jacked dudes there are almost always the nicest too - hell, if you don't already, maybe try the gym! It's great for meeting cool people and it betters your physical and mental health too! 

Finally, stay strong brother. You're young, you've got your whole life ahead of you and it'll be filled with ups and downs, challenges galore and plenty of arseholes. Don't let them get to you, keep your chin up and your strong heart beating through it all.

hrmfqc,fy54tz6,jennaau23,"Hey! I'm 30F, live in Australia. No (meaningful) friends. I don't have any social media (besides this). I live alone, never had a boyfriend. I am an introvert and have borderline personality disorder along with a host of other things: depression, anxiety, a little OCD, panic disorder. 

I would go so far as saying I've been lonely my whole life, and at 30 years of age I'm exhausted. I don't have any friends to go out and meet people, I don't have any friends to make connections to others, i study uni online so that's isolating as well (yes that was my choice but whatever). The depression and introvertedness keep me at home, but staying at home also fuels the depression. But if I go out, it's always on my own so like there's no joy there anyway. It's an awful cycle that keeps feeding off of itself.

I've tried online dating but I struggle to keep the other person interested. I don't have any outlandish hobbies so on paper I look boring but in person I feel I'm actually ok but they won't be able to see that unless I meet them but I struggle to get to that stage.

Loneliness is actuallly said to have an effect on the heart and that people can literally die of loneliness. I firmly believe that. I'd like to maintain hope that I will meet someone but (not having a pity party) I just feel that judging by the trajectory of my life, it's not going to change. And I have to make adjustments for that outlook. Most of the life decisions I make centre around me being single for the rest of my life. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

&#x200B;

I can understand how you feel. I used to feel it too. But things changed when i altered my thinking. Try to signal yourself that it isn't always negative. You can train yourself for that too. Like for example,

&#x200B;

1.  It is through this technology of Reddit that you were able to express yourself  so beautifully and connected with people like us. Also, there were people who felt relatable with you. So, technology might sometimes help.
2. Nobody is perfect. We all are socially awkward, even those who you see smiling and chatting all the time.
3. Studies have suggested that introverts mostly have high HQ's and intelligence, so they feel less connected to average IQ's. Think about that! You are not socially disconnected, just more smarter than the rest!
4. Find the source of Depression. We sometimes try hard to seek validation. Try writing a daily journal. Find a pattern in that. Work on it. Build yourself, follow your hobbies, create a life with positivity and optimism. This can only start with self awareness and self acceptance. So, happy writing!
5. If you are driven by negative emotions, then you cannot create a positive life! Just try to see the world as it is. And know that just as how our fingerprints are unique, our personalities too are! We should acknowledge each and every trait of ours.
6. Know your positive traits too, like you sound Intuitive, Thoughtful, Genuine. I am sure there would be more, only if you seek to find that in you. Just how google responds to the keywords you put in!

Back when Covid19 first hit hard in the alpha-wave,. around March-April 2020, I spent 38 days in Hospital and 16 of those in ICU on a Ventilator. At one point while on the Ventilator, my vital signs got so weak the equipment was having a hard time sensing me (and the infiltration in my lungs and septic infection throughout my blood stream was basically killing me. (if you want to see longer description including Lung X-rays, go [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/oi4b31/people_who_recovered_from_covid19_how_did_u/h4t9dek/?context=1) 

When my vital signs got borderline unreadable, Doctors recommended to my Employer that they schedule grief-counselors to be at my workplace that coming Monday morning to be ready in case I didn't make it and my coworkers needed therapy. 

Around that same time my Manager (who I highly respect) emailed out to our Dept and asked everyone to record audio-messages to me as motivation to fight my way out of the ICU coma. (I honestly don't know at that point how my body fought its way off deaths door.. but somehow it did)

Afterwards when I got off the Ventilator and had all the other various tubes pulled out of me.. I started re-orienting myself and I was able to find the Microsoft Teams channel where my coworkers had uploaded the Audio-file they had edited together that had all their motivational messages in it. It totally made me cry. 

It was a surreal experience for me because had I not pulled through,. I would have never been able to hear those messages. 

I just wanted to share that story, as someone who had struggled with dark depressive thoughts at different times in my life, we sometimes forget how much others around us appreciate and value us. We tend to spiral and think that we're ""worthless"",. but that's a lie.

eqifmu,fettjoj,somethingski,"Not sure, but I theorize it's a lack of empathy as a whole. 

Number 1) we're not taught emotional intelligence really at all -- despite them being completely natural and occuring all the time in the human experience, much like hunger. Imagine if we never taught or discussed the sensation of hunger. We'd all be terrified because we'd think we're some alien who gets a stomach pain every 6 hours, and you have to eat something like an animal to survive. See how dumb that sounds? Look at all the bad shit that happens when we don't talk about sex. 

Number2) As the wage gap widens and more of us fall into the group of have-less or have-nots we all are experiencing hardship and life becoming more of a struggle. Mix this in with a constant bombardment of messages saying ""This is what you need to be happy, or feeling this way? Buy this! Or look this way!"" 
Or we watch tv or scroll through social media and see people ""living the life"" and rather than seeing ourselfs as part of our direct communities and how we fit into that, we see performers as our peers and we get angry with ourselves when we can't ""keep"" up or we don't fit that mold. It starts to feel like despite everything you do its not enough. So we start to look at people who aren't pulling their weight to make it happen. 

This creates a perfect concoction of misplaced anger. Once angry it's easy to be swayed and manipulated by things. Its easy to not listen and jump to rash decisions because we're hurt. So we blame groups of people who we don't understand. The truth is we're all hurt. No one is out to get us, and everything is perception. The dark leads to light and light to dark in an endless dance of harmony. We all go in the end so really we're just competing with ourselves.

We need patience and understanding more than ever, especially with our world at stake.

I did not realize things were NOT ok while living in India- because I was blind. I was living under a rock too. I felt this is normal. (Almost) All MEN stare at females. Almost every female is eve teased. This is NORMAL- yeh toh hota hee hai. I have to wear a dupatta/ odhni properly over ALL my kurtas (with jeans) or else It would not look ‚Äòproper‚Äô.

Media, employers, papas or husbands assure you they are there for you. But that is not Independence? India is not independent from the regressive, misogynist chains and it may take a couple of centuries to break them.

Mental health treatment is a joke in most places.

You wanna see what happens if I go out and say I want to get diagnosed for depression ? I'll get laughed at. If I show anyone my self harm scars, they're going to mock me for being weak or blame me for not coping like my peers. The only way anybody ever 'sympathises' is when the person actually dies and then it's all 'i never saw it coming'.

So if anybody is coming online to talk about their problems. LET THEM. If anybody wants to access those resources. ALSO LET THEM.

GAHH

If I get one more comment from people, mocking teenagers for faking or having mental health problems, I'm going to deck someone.

It just makes people feel guilty for even approaching resources. People who like to believe that they can spot mental illness are a joke and they never actually have the intention of helping anyone.",34,1630437196.0,t3_pfa5s6,False

I have a family member who reacts similarity, and nothing I do or say resonates enough that they understand how I feel because they have a low threshold for empathy and gets defensive very easily, like my poor mental health is a personal attack. My way of dealing with it is to not talk about my mental state to that individual. It hurts because I still crave emotional support from this person, but I am not going to get it and it hurts more trying to share and getting shut down/shamed/guilt-tripped than to not say anything at all.

I sat here yesterday goin through every fluctuation of thought, even peeking at the ‚Äúdark side‚Äù slightly ( the topic this post is centered on). Recently I thought maybe I could open up to her due to time split after the Pandemic. I was wrong. 

She arrived in America, called my (now ex) girlfriend by the prior ones name multiple times - this eventually caused a rift that was already forming to get larger. We split while she was here, citing my mother & mental health as part of the reason. 

I ultimately DIDNT apologize and stated Its not my fault how she‚Äôs choosing to interpret information about my well being and converting it into something about her.

b5ru3w,ejffhwz,magpiegoo,"I really hate it. And it's often used *in* the mental health community, as a way of passing the problem down the line. ""Hey, that's not [my condition], that's borderlines you're talking about!"" ""Hey, that's not BPD, that's narcissists you're talking about!""

Like get a freaking grip, stop it. It's not ok. It's not ok to shit on your mental health condition, and it's not ok for you to pass the shit down and punch down on someone else's condition. No, not even if you think that condition is ""bad"".

I'll tell y'all a 100% fact. I've seen people with NPD who hate their diagnosis. Who go to therapy and fight it every day. They know what they do, but like anybody else with something like ADHD (making them forget) or Tourettes (making them tic) or BPD (making them cling and cry), they have problems with their condition making them act certain ways and it is *hard* learning to get through that.

ASPD? I know an absolute sweetheart with ASPD who is completely officially diagnosed. He doesn't really feel empathy, but he *knows* he doesn't feel empathy and he's stubborn about not letting that make him a bad person. So he *chooses* to act nice. Not because he feels empathy, b/c he doesn't, but because *he wants to*. He's actually one of the nicest people I know, he really goes out of his way to be supportive.

I know plenty of people *with* empathy who could stand to learn a lot from him.

When we use these terms as synonymous for ""bad person that I don't like"", or when we simply plain punch down on people with these diagnoses, we are being everything we hate about neurotypicals that treat us badly for *our* diagnoses and *our* problems that we can't help, and who use *our* labels as insults.

It gets tricky with Narcissist. Mainly because you can be narcissistic without having the personality disorder.

b5ru3w,ejgzvop,Fiber_fan,"There's a fair amount of research being done on the affects of mental illness terminology being used as derogatory language. And the research is pretty ugly. The more that mental illness terminology is used as insults, the less likely people who have it are to get treatment. And this is so much bigger than just one or two illnesses. This is all the language that should be used in reference to medical conditions being used as insults.  They are NEVER used in a positive manner. It is always a pejorative insult. 

And I find the whole thing infuriating and hypocritical. Think about how blatantly, brutally offensive if ""normal"" medical terminology was used in the same way.

""She's such a bitch. She must be diabetic.""

""Dude, you gotta dump that chick. She's epileptic.""

""This weather is so like a thyroid condition.""

""I am so getting laid tonight. You know what they say about cancer chicks.""

Not the criteria for a personality disorder. ",28,1553626912.0,t3_b5ru3w,False
b5ru3w,ejftwfo,coprolite_breath,"It is a lot more complicated than what peoole here tend to make it out to be.  I support that no one should be labled as having a mental illness without being diagnosed by a MD.  

I spend some time on a few of the mental health subreddits  where these words are thrown around alot.  I see a lot of people complaining or asking  about the behavior of a person they have interacted with.    A lot of these behaviors could be labled antisocial (sociopath) or narcissistic but that does not make that person NPD or ASPD.  They might just be a selfish asshole.  That is not a mental illness.  

There are also people on there who pretty certain they have suffered  mental abuse at the hands of someone behaving like narcissist / sociopath NPD/ASPD would.   I  would be one of these people (who was abused).

I developed pretty severe CPTSD from a 17 year marriage to a person I believe is a narcissist  or NPD , whatever you want to call it.  This person was never diagnosed with NPD and there is almost no chance they ever will be.  From their point of view there is nothing wrong with them.  They never had a problem with their cheating,  pathological lying,  stealing,  manipulating, gaslighting and  changing history...  A very low level of self awareness.  I have researched enough about narcissism and NPD to be pretty confident in my assessment.    This person had the severe  childhood neglect that served as the catalyst to cause them to put up strong mental walls and stop developing emotionally. 

Because  I am not mental health professional, my assessment is worth squat.  That being said,  according to the most recent DSM,  I never had CPTSD because it does not exist.  I wish I had know that before I attempted suicide or spent years stuck in a blind rage, sleeping 4 hours a night,  ruminating,  hypervigilant...  Then I would not have had to get EMDR therapy start to recover.  I guess my point is,  I got really screwed up because of mental and psychological abuse by another.  All of their behaviors fit the profile of what you would call a narcissist or NPD.    Basically all my trauma therapy revolved around what this person did over 17 years.  I am still figuring stiff out because the abuse and manipulation was very subtle.   And I did not learn what a NPD/narcissist was until I was well into therapy.  I was making a lot of progress but there was something big under the surface that I could not quite see.   The subtle abuse.

Back to Reddit,  when I see a post calling narcissists spawn of devil or something like that,  I am the first to point out that  these people have a horrible mental illness most likely caused by childhood trauma.  I cannot imagine what life must be like for them.  I feel horrible for my  children because their mother does not truly love them (in a way most of us would consider love).  Her love is based on getting her needs met.  I worry she may now be manipulating one of them to get her needs met.   I feel bad for my exwife and the abuse she suffered and what it made her into.  I picture it as she has created this whole artificial construct about herself and her world,  to make up  for what does not and cannot have emotionally.  Unfortunately it comes at the expense of others.

When I first got diagnosed with CPTSD,  the sense of being validated was incredible.  I knew I was messed up but knew I was not Bipolar as someone had convinced me I was over the past few years.  That subreddit helped me a lot.  When I got deeper into the root of my CPTSD,  some of the other disorder subreddits helped connect all of the dots.

But I agree there are quite a few posts about people acting antisocial or as a narcissist but the world is not crawling with ASPDs or NPDs.  They are not everywhere.   It sort of does diminish the impact of the abuse that some people went through at the hands of another.  Not trying to invalidate what anyone went through or their abuse or reaction to it.  But some things are just being being bad, or taking advantage of others.  ",15,1553627795.0,t3_b5ru3w,False

iah7ti,g1ovvie,SlightlyIncandescent,"You flaired this as a rant so I appreciate that you're not asking for advice and won't be offended if you don't read this or choose not to respond, I just feel the need to give you some input.

I don't know you and I'll probably never see you in my life so remember, I have no reason to lie to you. You're obviously a good person because doing something you see as wrong or a mistake bothers you, you're just clearly suffering from very low self confidence. I have things in my life too, where they are just minor mis-steps but I can't seem to forgive myself for them but I have enough self confidence to tell myself it's not that bad and I can forget about it for a while and when it happens again, I'll do the same again.

I had extremely low self confidence too up until around my early 20's and there are still aspects of it I'm working on now. I don't know you so I don't know what the cause of it is for you but for me, the main thing that helped was doing things to make myself feel as though I've generally got my shit together in life.

For me, having my shit together meant looking after my health, appearance, work life, social life and finances. Have a think about how happy you are with each aspect. If your confidence is low, I suspect you're not happy with at least a few of these.

It's hard to go into specifics because everyone is at a different level and you should only compare your progress to your past self rather than anyone else but again if I use myself as an example, health-wise I was relatively lax on personal hygeine. I'd shower but that's about it. My diet was OK but not great, I very occasionally went for a run but was generally unfit. Appearance-wise, I was wearing 10 year old hand me down clothes, a little overweight, I let my hair and beard grow and didn't do anything with them and didn't put any thought into style or fashion. In terms of work, I was working an easy/low stress but boring, low paid and generally unfulfilling job. In terms of social life, I have a GF and one great friend but really no other good friends and I found it difficult to talk to new people. In terms of finances, I was on minimum wage but no real commitments so I got by and could still afford a few luxuries.

The first change I made was to start going to the gym. I found ways to make it enjoyable so I was able to stick to it. it really had a massive positive impact on my mood and when I started to see the results, I gained a lot of confidence. Once the gym became habit, I started to think about style. I'd been putting some money aside to throw/give away any clothes I hadn't deliberately chosen and buy some new clothes. Sounds expensive I know, but it doesn't have to be. Once I only owned clothes I had deliberately chosen, I started to look at moisturising my skin, styling my hair and smelling good. Again, this doesn't need to be expensive. With work, I didn't even apply for the types of job I actually wanted, I must have beleived I wouldn't get them. It was pretty much a case of applying for the jobs I actually wanted and I found something better, this obviously improved the financial side of things.

It's taking some time, it's been a couple of years since I consciously started to do this but my next steps are going to be to put myself out of my comfort zone in terms of social interaction by trying to communicate more with my GF, try starting conversations with people I don't know and that kind of thing. I don't see this as having an end goal and that's fine, it gives me a real sense of purpose.

Basically humans (and most animals) naturally establish a 'pecking order' in their head of people in their life and people with low self-worth/self-confidence are going to put themselves at the bottom. We all naturally like good looking, confident and accomplished people so improving these aspects of your life is going to help your confidence.

It may be that you're starting at a different point, maybe you're very overweight and your first step in improving yourself is just going for a walk. Maybe you haven't left the house for a while and just leaving the house or taking a shower is your first goal, that's cool.

 this has helped so much, I still have few interactions but I know they won't be my last. So just keep working at it. You'll always say one thing wrong until you know the wrong thing to say. 

2) (this one is much much harder for me) Learning to accept that not everyone will like you. Even if you are number 1 in social skills you'll still upset or rub someone the wrong way, it could be a view, it could be because you're wearing a hat, etc. You can't get along with everyone all the time, but you can get along with some people most of the time you just have to find them.

mjbdxp,gtadfmn,Hazed_blue,"Two things.  

1) Practice living mindfully.  It's using techniques that allow you to fully enter whatever moment you're in.  Like if you're cooking dinner, don't put a show on.  Instead, cook that dinner as if it's the very first time you are doing it.  Listen to the food sizzling on the pan, watch the oil being poured, smell the aroma of the vegatables.  Living mindfully slows everything down.  Also, keep a daily journal.  I can't tell you how much more full the weeks and months feel when I can record things I've felt and experienced every day.

2) Forget about the halfway mark or any garbage like that.  It's useless and unrealistic.  At 39, I used to get myself depressed about that, but then I realized that there is a huge difference between life, and life living.  If you have 10 years, who's to say that you can't experience 20 years of wonderful moments in that 10 by trying new things and allowing yourself to enjoy them?  Time is a construct, and you can bend it both ways.  I have no idea how long I will be on this earth, nor does anyone else.  Maybe I live another 10 and someone who's 60 lives another 30.  No one knows.  So why fret over what you ""have left,"" a number that's completely arbitrary?  

Connect with the world around you, go on walks, take time to be in nature.  Be in the very moment you're in, and you'll feel everything slow down.",47,1617487197.0,t3_mjbdxp,False

I believe what you might be going through is what is often refered to as the midlife crisis.
This is a normal part of growing up and going through different parts of life.

It seems that you have already pointed out a few things you would like to change to better your life(being alone, smoking pot), so my suggestion will be that you try and change these things and move to where you want to be. Just don‚Äôt expect it to be changed by tomorrow, but luckily for you, time moves fast.

Remember that you have to drive the change you want to see, no one will do it for you. Numbing the feelings of not reacting to this, with substances will keep your vision blurred from where you want to go. If you cannot handle these feelings by yourself, seek some help to sort it out, talk to a therapist, absolutely nothing wrong with that.

I feel like sometimes what people want is just for someone to listen, to let them know that the hurt they're feeling is something understandable and valid to feel, even if it's not objectively rational or true. That is, not to say ""oh yeah, you're totally right you should end it"" but to sit with someone at their darkest moment, truly try to listen and get what they're saying, to empathize with what they're feeling as much as possible. It sometimes feels like common suicide prevention tactics, while coming from a good place, feel like people shouting you down and telling you that what you're feeling is wrong, illusory and shameful; when that's all you hear it can often be the opposite of what those people intend because it's treating someone who's already upset in a very aggressive and distraught manner that makes people, ironically, feel even crazier and alone than they did when they started.

I don't have a good, universally applicable solution because it's hard to communicate understanding, empathy and even relating to sentiments personally without condoning the feelings as objectively true and actionable, but at the same time if you get rid of that and the only way you can approach talking to suicidal folks is to howl NO DON'T DO IT YOU'LL HURT EVERYONE YOU LOVE AND IT GETS BETTER I PROMISE then that's not particularly healthy either, because that is often the opposite of comforting and uplifting especially as a very vocal, almost universal response.",11,1671450819.0,t3_zphs1x,False

I first got a taste of this when my father passed away two years ago. I couldn‚Äôt stand seeing people be happy during Thanksgiving while I was hurting, as selfish as that may sound. Taking a two-month break from Instagram and other social media helped me focus on myself and health as well as my family during that difficult time.

I believe in your case, maybe try taking a break for two weeks and see how that goes for your mental health?

**Why did I quit Social Media?**

\- Social Media is simply escapism. It makes you ignore your life problems and makes you believe you can escape them. Pure BS.

I cherish it to this day. I feel lighter, happier because I embraced my problems. Life is chaos and you'll face tough life situations. Escaping them won't change anything. Facing them heads on will though.

I can tell you‚Äôve made a lot of progress in your recovery based on how you talk about this experience. The quote above is where you revert to old behaviors. Consider what your DBT training would have to say about that interpretation. It effectively takes the onus of responsibility from your therapist and places it on you. I know you say this was consensual, but there are degrees of consent. Given your history and the fact that there is a significant power disparity in the therapist-client relationship (i.e., she knows wayyyy more about you than you do about her, and knowledge is power), she effectively coerced you into sexual activity *that you admitted you did not want* (i.e., you were not attracted to her and you experience guilt and shame after engaging in that pattern of behavior).

I‚Äôm sorry this happened to you. Being coerced into sex is never okay, and especially when the person engaging in the coercion is someone you‚Äôve trusted with some of your deepest moments. You might not think of it this way, but I consider that a betrayal of your trust and a betrayal of the profession. You are well within your rights to report this anonymously to the APA ethics board. You might not be the only person she has victimized, and having a trail of data points can help ethics board hold violators accountable and protect patients.

The mental health community has put the carriage before the horses. With the amount of advertisement and pro-mental health talk, you'd believe there was a huge proverbial army ready to provide ""help"". The reality is the system and resources are scarce, expensive, slow, lackluster, disparate, and dismissive.

At a time when a person is struggling, desperate, suicidal, barely able to function at a base level, and falling apart; on top of all that they're expected to navigate the garbage system of resources while being told ""your life is your own responsibility"".

This isn't meant to be a dart against any individual mental health professionals. There are some great people out there working hard to do what they can to help. 

But the reality is, our understanding of the mental health issues and the resources needed to combat those issues just aren't at a robust enough level yet, and it's actually damaging to get people's hopes up about finally fixing their issues and then facing the realities of the system.

But here‚Äôs the thing - you are on the right path. You are seeking help, and being an advocate for yourself. Most people never even do that. Seek the help that works, move on from what doesn‚Äôt. Find a therapist who you really connect with. Who challenges you, supports you, and is able to answer your questions about treatment. It‚Äôs our job to do those things, at a bare minimum. 

There are more resources now than there‚Äôs ever been. Search for podcasts. Search for apps (psyberguide.com). Find lists of good books or blogs that talk about what you‚Äôre struggling with. Let getting better be the focus of your life. 

Ironically, sometimes people with more challenging mental health difficulties improve their lives than those with more mild, or ‚Äúmanageable‚Äù challenges because they‚Äôre more motivated to get better.

But many cultures on Earth would, for instance, consider any solution that doesn't involve the whole family to be worthless or pointless. Or parts of the world in which meditation is considered as important as sleep. Or cultures where receiving therapy from someone who isn't also a close friend, someone connected to you and your life, is out of the question.

Those who are mentally ill may not have self awareness now, but they won't realize that until they are shown to be introspective about their behaviors; save for those whose disorder makes it difficult for them to be self-aware, such as the delusional. Schizophrenics tend to have a good deal of self-awareness, and show that even if they don't have it now, that they are capable. You can choose to deny everyone around you, absolutely.

Then don't!  Focus on other thoughts instead. 

**Goal-Inconsistent Automaticity**

When you try to shove those thoughts out of your head, you're engaging in something called *goal-inconsistent automaticity.*. It's a long phrase for a simple concept, where you're telling your mind to do something where the steps for performing the task require it to fail the task.  It's easier with an example:

I want to stop thinking about pinecones, so I tell my brain to stop doing that.  I want to shove all thoughts of them out of my brain.  So how would I achieve that?  Easy!  My brain translates my command into the following steps:

1. Compare all thoughts to pinecones
2. If a thought involves pinecones, push it away.  Otherwise, allow it to stay. 

Sounds simple enough, right?  The issue is this involves me constantly thinking of pinecones to verify other thoughts are not of pinecones.  Thus, to stop thinking of pinecones directly, I must think of pinecones.  To complete the task, I must fail the task. 

**What to Do Instead**

Sounds pretty paradoxical, huh?  So that's why I'm not going to tell my brain to directly get rid of the thoughts of pinecones.  Instead, I'll tell it to think of something else, something easy to visualize, like drops of water falling from an icicle glowing in the warm sunlight as it slowly melts over the green grass and the feeling as I place my hand under it--the antithesis between the warm sunlight on my skin and the frigid droplet hitting my palm and the little secondary droplets bouncing off to the surrounding skin, like a serene perversion of shrapnel.  

Or maybe try something technical.  I've found giving detailed explanations over things (like goal-inconsistent automaticity, for instance haha) often helps ground me so I calm down.  Things that elicit happy or neutral emotions.  Pretend you're a professor teaching a class about something you find interesting.


**Summary**

You only have so much capacity to focus on things, so use that to your advantage.  The larger other thoughts become, the smaller the ones you're trying to avoid will be. But directly trying not to think about it will make you think about it even more than if you'd done nothing at all.

You are not the sole author of your mind, but you are the narrator, and that is far more powerful.",31,1699974207.0,t3_17v0099,False

from an academic position (qualifications: i am a sociologist with a specialization in mental health and society, working in early intervention for both short and long term mental health disability claims professionally) we see it reproduced study after study that finances, under the current political system of capitalism, impact every. aspect. of our lives. 

when we struggle economically, it‚Äôs more than just worrying about money. it‚Äôs often living in disadvantaged neighbourhoods (even impacting physical health as well- e.g. heightened exposer to pollution for example), or more industrial neighbourhoods due to lowered cost of living (often lacking green space such as parks and forests, which is known to have a positive effect on those living in neighbourhoods including them) attending lower achieving and under-funded schools, heightened exposure to violence and crime due to community stress, and lacking accessibility to extra curricular‚Äôs and activities just to name a few examples that *dramatically* impact our quality of life. in young children, damaging their developmental opportunities and often setting them on the pathway for mental hardship across the lifespan as a result. these individuals are also much more susceptible to co-morbidity of both mental and physically diseases and illnesses which only further impact their accessibility to work, support, and other resources critical in our current system. 

a very large discourse present in my studies has been the miss conception that individuals are mentally ill because they are in poverty, but the data very clear shows that it is about far more than just the money; rather the societal disadvantages that are disproportionately affecting the impoverished communities and the lack of resources to support them (of course, hand in hand with economic strain as we know this is a great stressor in and of itself, i grew up quite poor and while i won‚Äôt speak personally we know that this is alone enough to tip an individual or family over). an important part of my professional philosophy is that early intervention starts far before the individual is deemed mentally ill - it begins in building stronger communities to supplement economic (all inequalities, but economic within the context of this conversation) inequalities as preventative measures to protect the quality of life and overall mental health for our most vulnerable populations.",7,1641828121.0,t3_s0hb4b,False

I think you're conflating 'happiness' with 'pleasure' or 'enjoyment'

rainbows and butterflies may be pleasurable, but the source of happiness is within, not out there in the world.

when it is out there in the world, it does not last.

what's the longest time one stayed happy about a good meal, a car, a new pair of shoes?

true and lasting happiness has to do with purpose, meaning, fulfillment, and the core of our humanity - what we become despite what happens to us.

Perhaps Viktor Frankl's example might be of relevance here.

He survived the holocaust in concentration camps, and later became psychiatrist. Here's what he writes:

# ""We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread.

# They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms‚Äîto choose one‚Äôs own attitude in any given set of circumstances‚Äîto choose one‚Äôs own way.""

On the one hand, it was great that these people were taking an interest in their family member's illness and trying to learn more about it. It should be a priority to foster these learners. I mean, within my own organization, my mental health team can't expect to enact a culture change unless we're able to educate and win over people without mental illness, if only because they make up the bulk of the congregation. So family members being there should have been a *good* thing.

On the other hand, it felt (to me) like they were speaking over the mentally ill voices present and generally kind of dog-piling onto the idea of 'how sad and pathetic mentally ill people are'. I already feel like shit for the stuff my mental illness puts my family members through, and I didn't really need to hear it reiterated over and over again.

Ever hang out with some one who just complains all the time? If you're on the receiving end of this, how does it make you feel? Generally you start to match their energy and as everyone has already said on this thread it gets tiring. 

Another reason is because the conversation is always about them and never about you. You ever engage with someone who just talks about their life and their situation? Where's the reciprocity of the exchange? 

Last bit not least is the negativity of it all. No one likes to hang out with a negative person all the time. If all a person does is complain about their life, them that's what their going to be associated with. ""That person who just complains"". 

Granted it's okay for life to not perfectly go your way and you need someone to vent your frustrations but the main thing both parties need to get out of it is:

lo9nyr,go61bq7,1_weirdo_1,"I know the feeling,  it SUCKS SO MUCH!  

I have felt alone in life before, (still do a little) and I have felt like my life sucks and nothing will get better any time soon. I had several therapist sessions with 2 different therapist (about1 1/2 years apart)- the first was bad and the second was only a little productive because of my previous experience.

I have since my first therapy session(about 2 1/2 years ago) have improved a lot. I still have a long way to go but I have recently been like, yes I am flawed and I am amazing person, which is somthing I am proud of.

What in hindsight I recognised helped me is being exposed to diffrent mindset and ideas. AND mental health posts and therapist talking about mental health. That and a lot of introspection.

-----------------
My Advice:
-----------------

-  acknowledge your sucky situation & feelings
allow yourself to be sad/ angry/ sorry for yourself  whatever you feel it is okay.  
   BUT don't stay there for too long (set an appropriate time from       few minutes to couple hours, or weeks- depends on the event and it's effects on you) and then make yourself feel better and do something productive or just start with doing something fun or even something you don't hate

-  watch and be exposed to new mindsets and ideas 
(I recommend Impact theory) it will make you feel better, shift your perspective and eventually move you to action (if you listen)

-  watch and listen to mental health topics and therapist, 
research more what you relate to. It will help you understand what you are going through and give good tips to apply

-  the most important part is to be introspective 
reflect on yourself and your situation or the two bullet points above might not be as effective. You can do so through journaling: write or record- audio or video. It is important here to mention that because you are not talking to a neutral party, to remember to try and reflect detaching yourself from your emotions as they can cloud your judgement. (Eg Feeling anxiety can make you think people are out to get you or people don't like you when that is not true.)

- Take action
Add things to your life that make it better or more fun
Remove things that you can remove that make your life worse (small or big, random acquaintance, habit, lamp, make-up, anything)

- lean on your support system 
I don't know enough to give advice on this topic, but what I do know that having a good person and having a healthy relationship is very important. It shows you it is possible to have a health relationship, what it looks/feels like, and it can give you a safe space to be.

I put the remains in a small jewelry box I had so he could have a proper burial for him.

Do you remember what life was like before the circumstances you ended up in made you suicidal? What would need to change in order for you to feel like life's worth living again? Which circumstances are preventing you from getting better?

What I've gathered from your post is that your job is likely one of the things that are making your life miserable and I can't accept someone dying for a stupid job. Fuck that job. I know there might are situations that are making it nearly impossible to change it, but you have nothing to lose at this point. It's either the job or your life. And I don't think any job ever would be worth more than anyone's life. Imagine if it was your husband, someone from your family or a close friend, would you prefer they died or stopped working for a while? What if they never worked again? Would you still love and care for them if they had an illness that prevented them from working? Well guess what, you have the illness. And if you two love each other it's very likely that they'd feel about you the way you answered those questions yourself. You wouldn't allow them to take themselves away from you because of a job. Or anything in the world. But I don't really know, just something to figure out for yourself. 

I've been in a situation where the circumstances I got myself in made me want to end my life and now I'm glad I didn't. I gave myself time off and after a while I got better, brain just does it on itself if you cut out the shit that was fucking it up so much. I regained enough will to live and the capacity of thinking about what could I do for money that would not make me miserable and prioritized it because it's either that or my life.

I know how depressed brain works and how hard it is to have any hope or optimism, but I have hope for you. You've reached out and that's probably the best step you could do for yourself now.

technology can be like a magic wand... make some things easier, but it has a cost beyond just the monetary. we lose a lot of our natural connection with many things that make living on this world so special, including ourselves

For Baby boomers, mental institutions were done away with and the mentally ill were basically put into the streets.  At the same time, I think boomers were much more inclined to remove mentally ill people from their lives, churches, and communities. 

Also, capitalism really became culturally paramount.   Ideals like not being selfish, like taking responsibility for mistakes, giving back to family, friends, church, one's community etc began to decline.  Those old ideals were replaced with selfishness being seen as a virtue, scape goating and social violence (rumor spreading/character assassination, etc) were a basic sign of intelligence, and breaking rules to make as much money as possible was seen as a good thing even if it broke social norms or even was harmful to society.  (Pyrimid skeems, Enron etc, moving manufacturing out of the US).

And I have I guess you what you would call like a substitute mom cuz I still have my mom but Mexican and she knows I'm trying to learn some stuff. Another lady I work with taught herself in her first marriage, so if I want to speak to her I can learn that way too so. 

Who knows maybe you'll go and write a letter if this lady still alive and send it, if not there's also letter therapy where you write a letter and you burn it, because that lady has probably been so nasty and negative to so many children throughout her lifetime that she probably doesn't even remember.

I was recommended antidepressants and so far they are helping but am going back soon for a dosage adjustment which should help more. 

I‚Äôm right there with you on the beginning of the journey. Luckily I found a cheap therapist through Open Path that lets me afford this and the meds/visit to my medical professional was through a nonprofit, so I was able to afford it all without health insurance. That was the biggest obstacle, aside from actually willing myself to go. 

Always told myself I would *never* do two things: see a therapist or take antidepressants.. and, things change. I wish I was more open minded to it sooner, but life goes on.

It's broken for weeks, but you can't just walk after. You're in atrophy, there's no muscle and while the bone is healed, you're too weak to use it. So you rehab it - hard. 

But then, you realize they never caught your nerve or ligament damage in your scans, or they didn't think to perform scans. So you then have to address those if you even can. You go to a doctor who says there's probably no ligament damage and you should be fine. But you're not, and they didn't even run a scan. 

So your ankle gradually gets better, and soon enough you can walk with assistance and then without. You still may need your opiates for a whole year, and by then you may be addicted. What was once a PRN is now something you'll hit up strangers for. Opiates, benzos, same difference.

But your ankle is never fully pain free again. It certainly never feels the same, and you may have to always do things differently. You may have to be forever conscious of your gait to make sure you're walking straight, or you may only move your ankle in a square instead of a circle.

Yes. Like when I was 17 I went to Walmart to buy gasoline and everyone laughed at me. I usually never went there and I assumed for some reason they'd have small amounts. First vehicle. Moped. All the other kids had cars at 16

My history teacher made us rap and my line was ""tabla rusa, tabla rusa"". Ugh...I deadpan said it so bad it was just.....gross.

Whenever I quote songs like saying the words normally to make a point I cringe even if the point is good and feel like a jerk. 

I deleted my old Facebook from like dinosaur days but I read my messages to my last ex and I sounded like a total idiot with these enamoured half messages a total lovestruck dumb 20 year old/21 year old. So bad I can't even replicate it. I guess I'd say half a sentence and use those ellipses. I can't. Just lame. And now I see that her responses weren't exactly reciprocal, but in person we had many great moments (a couple terrible but mostly good)

I spent 4 minutes trying to copy a long joke from a famous comedian that I hadn't memorized and wanted to die twice the next morning (back during drinking days)

Every single thing romantically I said to my ex, ex girlfriend. Weird the kinks I had were really demented and showed my childhood trauma and idk if I really have accepted it 10 years later that I ""made"" her do ""that"" stuff. We had like consent paper level relations so don't worry lol.

  !!On a lighter note in school I jumped over a desk which was impressive but I kneed myself in the face haha. I still cleared it. Also I remember getting hit directly in the face with a big red dodgeball and it sent the back of my head in a brick wall like an anime fight lmao..people did ask if I was ok but I was like ""yeah I'm fine"" but my face felt like I got blasted with a bomb or something. 

Pain: Not super cringe in traditional way but I remember I tried to jump from one slippery rock onto another and hit my bony shin, and the rock cut in deep. I was in agony and in this area the fastest way home was up a dirt and mud wall so I literally had two daggers on me and had to pull myself up pushing with one leg, walk through the woods and walk slowly to my apartment. Blood was dripping down my leg (In shorts) and a cop passed me and didn't stop to ask if I was ok. Still have scar.

Pain: Another one, I was playing as a kid and jumped into a closet and a metal coat hanger ripped my inner thigh open from my hip down to my knee, I don't remember anything except seeing the insane scar. My mom swears I didn't need the hospital but the scar looks way too big.

Racism as a very young kid that slipped out: This one is bad...I had to have a tooth fixed or pulled as a young kid very young and they used a drill and it was my first surgery and the dentist was black, I got in a lot of pressure and pain and I yelled out the n word. God it was so bad. I think I apologized to him even at 6 years old but I KNOW my mom did. Fuck....why. so horrible.

There are much more traumatic ones that are like flashbacks and stuff but I can stop there. I mean dark horrible moments (K.O.R.N sue ice ide and worse and I do not want to trigger your PTSD if you're reading this) 


I have plenty of beautiful romantic like movie scene quality moments from my relationships in my late teens and early 20s before I became alone forever... I have good memories of my family to go with the bad. Many great memories with my brother, us guys watching certain hilarious TV show famous moments when they premiered, my cousins being really awesome and playing Yu-Gi-Oh, Sega and ps1 and all laughing and having fun. Relaxing car rides to extended family's houses for Christmas, the only hug my dad ever gave me (we're cool he's just very old school), so there's a mixed bag. 


Sorry for the super long reply, maybe some of these small anecdotes are interesting or cathartic to someone reading.

I am not a mental health professional (just a really messed up person myself), but to me it sounds like these issues may be a good candidate for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). There are a ton of self-help resources on this topic, so you don‚Äôt need to work with a therapist unless you really want or need to.  CBT is useful when there are specific thoughts or behaviors it can work on.

CBT is just one type of therapeutic intervention or ‚Äúmodality‚Äù. It may or may not work for you and/or for this specific issue for you. If it doesn‚Äôt work, there are plenty more modalities to try, so don‚Äôt give up on trying to overcome this issue :) We often learn negative self-talk from internalizing abuse from our parents, so if that sounds like your experience, that may be another healing path to explore.

You may not be ready to hear this yet, but a large part of healing mental health injuries is self-compassion. 

There is a healthy line somewhere between taking personal responsibility, and understanding that we were shaped and damaged by our life experiences. I, for example came from neglect, so there‚Äôs a lot of adult life and emotional skills that I just never learned. I‚Äôve made so many mistakes that people who developed properly don‚Äôt make. My self-compassion is understanding that doing my best often involves failures, and my personal responsibility is that I‚Äôm striving to learn and grow myself from those failures.

I‚Äôm so happy you‚Äôre aware that your negative self-talk is problematic and you‚Äôre looking to change that. You are very smart and savvy to be here with this deep understanding of yourself. More hugs!",2,1664388653.0,t3_xqeh2x,False

Your traumas are valid, your traumas are real. Do not invalidate them by saying other people have it worse. Everyone has their own story and everyone's traumas are important. Do not invalidate yourself by comparing to others. Relate, but do not compare. 

That was one of the most influential and useful things I learned during my PHP. This lesson was the main thing that helped me pull thru.

While the idea is an unrealistic one in most settings not approaching or already in a state of apocalypse (I guess we aren't all that far off here in the US though), anyways that's Terence Mckennas idea of the Archaic Revival or small local communities operating as cooperative but ultimately self sufficient isolated units where each member of a community has a specific duty to keep himself, his family, his farm or business, and ultimately his community going strong. I guess in a sense this is similar to the commune idea minus some of the baggage of the term. 

Recently I had the thought that going to work everyday is like putting a middle man in between you and working for what you need to survive. Farming your own land and living off of the food and income that provides would be the wholesale deal without the middle man taking a cut. In our currently global system one can easily (and often does in lower paying jobs) have such a siloed niche function that its often impossible to know what you are ultimately contributing to or who it is for. This imo is the ultimate realization of life without meaning. Combine that with the growing vacuum of spirituality (and sometimes morality as a result) in the west after the collapse of the american congregation/mass starting sometime around the 1950s, and we have a damn good recipe for the global increase in depression and mental illness, suicide, chronic illness, mass shootings (which along with other things such as the role of SSRIs could be nothing more than a need for the expression or realization of the isolation and social sickness of our people individually. Mass shootings imo could turn out to be nothing more than an (ill)perceived means to reasserting power or control which again, often arise out of a need to exert control over ones life which likely arises as a perceived need in the first place out of the low drone of many lives without meaning interacting. 

The good news is that I've definitely noticed personally, and later confirmed with so many others who operate in these spheres, that recently many people have seen a serious rekindling of interest in the spiritual. I have been fortunate to have been in the position to have witnessed and grown alongside the formation of what I can only describe as a sort of new religion which has come to fruition as the result of the global connectivity and sharing of knowledge afforded to us by the internet. This allows seekers and everyday folk to explore correlating ideas across cultures separated by thousands of miles, and sometimes thousands of years to develop a globally inclusive and concise spiritual framework which is founded equally upon a variety of sources both modern and ancient and is inclusive of both western science and Christianity, indigenous traditions of the Inca, the Hopi, the Anasazi as well as those of the Aboriginal tribes and some African tribes, as well as religious philosophies both exo and esoteric or pagan, to create a very compelling and holistic understanding of who we are and why we are here (or who I AM and why I AM here). I think a lot of people subscribe to fundamental concepts related to these ideas without even knowing it, as its broad like I said, but concise in its fundamental purpose. It doesn't have a formal name that I am aware of as of yet (could be seen as a sort of Spiritualism 2.0 combined with a touch of new thought? New-Age is too broad and contains too much pure bullshit, but if you are interested try looking into the ideas of the holofractal universe, Robert Monroes work, Tom Campbell, Edgar Cayce, Ram Dass to name a few.

1) Ok so some people I know used ReachOut NextStep (here's the link) : https://link.au.reachout.com/www/linknextstep/index.html#/
Personally I never used it but a lot of friends have and said it was very helpful ! 
First, they want to know what's going on. There will be sentences (for example ""I've lost all hope"" or ""I have zero motivation"" etc) and if you relate to them, you select them. Then they'll ask how much it's affecting you etc... At the end, they'll recommend you supports options like apps, forums, chat, info and self-help, phone and face to face services.
Don't worry, it's free and anonymous.

2) There is TherapistAid.com too. There are a lot of worksheets to help you so you can work on that by yourself (there are articles, interactives and videos too) 
And it's not only for depression but for ADHD, anxiety, stress, emotions, self-esteem, parenting, anger issues etc as well...

I really hope it will help you.

Get your bloodwork checked, vitamin deficiencies can cause depression. It's been scientifically proven that fish oil pills can have the same affect as Prozac when you have a deficiency.

Change your diet. Easier said than done, I know. But your gut microbiome is directly connected to your mood. Also eating whole foods vs processed is just good for long-term health.

Get outside several times a day, even if it's just for 10 minutes. Getting sunlight or UV rays directly into your eyesight at different points in the day helps reset your circadian rhythm and aids in healthy sleep. If you're not sleeping well, that can cause depression.

Celebrate this chance to be alive and breathing. 

I enjoyed reading your story and I'm thankful that you met that officer. Sometimes people don't realize how much just listening can make a difference. I had a really hard day about 2 weeks ago. I was sure I was lost forever. I took a drive as you did and found a place to park and sit while I searched my mind for peace. A random car drove by me (I was off the beaten path) and I felt this outrageous desire to flag them down and just spill my guts to them. I somewhat hoped they would just stop and ask if I was doing alright since my face was red and flushed from my tears. It was so weird. I felt like I needed to let go what I had inside so bad. I never flagged them down and they never stopped as they probably didn't even really notice me. 

I calmed myself and took out my journal. I spoke to my Dad (I lost him when I was young) and just let my feelings spill out on that piece of paper. It felt so good just scribbling my thoughts as I let myself go. I realized some of what you said and dug deep to find that love for myself, that reason I need to be alive. I forgave my stupidity and accepted that everything will be ok, as long as I decide to make it that way. We have to do damage control with ourselves sometimes. I heard something a while back and it's got me through some shit. ""Calm yourself, the storm will pass.""

When I got home, I burned those pages and took some time to appreciate all that I do have in my life. I realized that shit will always hit the fan eventually and that it's important to learn how to accept the bad and figure out how to find the good in those dark times. Supporting yourself and giving yourself that love you deserve is so important. I hope you are feeling alright my friend.

In your context you're an abused child/teen, so of course telling your parents ""Your child, your rules"" is a terrible idea.

If it's a parent who got stopped in the street and shouted at for feeding their child a cookie, then ""Your child, your rules"" is way more relevant and makes sense. 

I agree with you that it is overused and over-simplified because people like short and simple phrases even if the nuance behind them is more complex. It's really just to remind parents that it's ok to ignore unsolicited and unhelpful advice from judgy people in the street because every family  situation is different and has different rules. (Of course, those rules should be non-abusive, but most people don't feel the need to *say* that because they think it's obvious.)

"" Never have I heard someone put it in the way you just did (""Your illness is your own personal abuser... You wouldn't emotionally abuse another person, so why abuse yourself? ""), and I thank you for the perspective. 

It is a subtle change in the way of thinking, but a change that can make a huge difference. 

You may FEEL far behind everyone else, but you have achieved a perception that many people don't achieve in their entire lives.

c647ep,es6gjri,Ten_of_Wands,"I hear you there brother. I've had a similar experience myself. I was smart and did good in high school and was going to college for free on a scholarship. But I got hit really hard with depression and I dropped out of school and  quit my job. Also, I lost my scholarship so I really screwed myself over with that one. Since then I've worked several terrible jobs, and I've hated all of them. But I still have hope of going back to college and and getting a degree. I tried last year and failed due to mental issues, but I am going to try again this year.

I think you're on the right track with getting rid of the negative thoughts about yourself. In your last paragraph you say you need to be mindful that those thoughts aren't really your thoughts, and that they are just a manifestation of your anxiety/depression. This is true. Meditation can help you separate yourself from your thoughts and see that they don't always mean anything. 

Also, you said that video games help you get your mind off the thoughts. Focusing on something always helps, but video games can be a waste of time (unless you're a successful twitch streamer). I would recommend getting a hobby to help. Learn a skill like cooking, or playing the guitar, or even writing. You seem like a well written individual, judging from what you wrote.

Talking back to that inner voice was a favorite method of mine too, only I never egged it on. Instead, and I hope this doesn't sound too crazy, I would imagine that negative inner abuser as a physical thing, like a shadow person or my inner child. The inner child made most sense to me. I'd close my eyes and let myself listen to it's judgements and fears like I'd listen to, say, my niece or a close friend who was hurting. Then I'd talk to it, ""teach"" it another view, comfort it. It was sort of meditative and certainly therapeutic.

Men are humans too. Society has conditioned men improperly, making them feel humiliation and degradation for showing just an ounce of feeling.

To invalidate, then joke about the pain, or feelings they have deeply upsets me.

My boyfriend was conditioned to hold it in.... holding it in is very unhealthy. It takes a toll on a person, not only mentally, but physically as well. 

He has held emotion, and issues back for so long, that he'll often let loose all at once. To watch it all pour out of him, and throw that excessive weight he's held onto down, it's... it's a very sad sight to see.

My uncle always says ""Be a man"", I've never seen the man cry, or tell anyone he loves them... he's very brash, uptight, doesn't even like to be hugged... men like that seem to carry the most judgement. It feels sociopathic to me, it feels that way because they carelessly tend to a ""Mans"" needs... they don't see their problem, and they don't realize they add onto problems with their nonchalant behavior/attitude.

I'm a woman, a grown woman who supports men, their mental health, their emotions, feelings, issues, pain, and so forth. I as a woman, would like to stand with the men who feel as though they don't have a voice... I am with you all.

Women who put men down for crying, or for feeling hurt, depressed, anxious, sad... they need to wake up.

A woman nutures the man, provides love, care, respect, makes sure that he is alive... just like a man provides love, care, respect, and makes sure that she is alive as well.

It goes both ways. We (both men & women) share this planet, along with the resources provided... we should build each other up... a man needs just as much love as a woman does.",5,1561339944.0,t3_c44zo9,False

I 100% agree. I‚Äôm frequently upset by the ways in which society robs men of emotional and mental wellbeing. It hurts absolutely everyone. Men are such visceral and emotionally intuitive humans and we really strangle it out of them. Men‚Äôs mental health is a public health issue. 

You‚Äôd probably really enjoy this series of blog articles by Robert Whitley, a huge men‚Äôs mental health advocate and researcher. The latest article about the ‚Äúdouble bind‚Äù is a really good read.

My high school friend‚Äôs dad died by suicide and it was an incredibly tragic event.

To be honest, the ""man up"" saying is just aggressive ego trying to tell you to face your problems without actually telling you HOW to face your problems which I can see why it would come off as upsetting. The thing is, maybe not everyone, but a lot of people who face depression/anxiety constantly want to talk about their problems without actually doing anything to get rid of them - i.e. I am sad, heres why I'm sad, I'm not going to conclude how I can feel better because I don't know how, now I'll distract myself to get rid of the sadness. 

&#x200B;

If you truly want happiness/mental stability, don't be skeptical this advice and consider what I have to say/interpret it your way. Start off by practicing meditation (which may sound like an arduous task at first, but if you force yourself to do it you will start to get used to it and likely enjoy it). Start out maybe 5 minutes a day. Find a nice calm environment to sit down, relax and close your eyes. Focus on your breath, and try to not control it. Let your subconscious breathe for you, and really try to pay attention to your thoughts. Face your fears and don't hesitate. Thinking about how your friend said something mean to you the other day? Realize how that thought has such an impact on your mood and how it makes you upset. This is perfectly normal. Start by facing those thoughts with kindness. It's OK that I'm upset right now. In 1 year, it won't matter to me that Jim said something mean yesterday and made me feel embarrassed for a bit. 

&#x200B;

Once you get adjusted to meditation, start making goals for your future. Where do you want to be in 1 year? 5 years? 10 years? Write them down pen and paper, or maybe on your laptop. As long as you are training yourself to think positively you can basically outline a better future for yourself/better version of you that YOU aspire to be. Don't let others decide who your going to be, cause to be honest everyone is on their own path and your's (not to be harsh) probably doesn't matter to people that much because almost everyone on this earth is self-centered and focused on their own well being(not in a bad way). 

&#x200B;

Working out is great for mental health. Its extremely hard to get started if you haven't done before, but its totally worth it in the long run. Working out can release endorphins in the brain that make you happier and give you a stronger sense of well-being. Run on the treadmill once a week, then up it to twice, then thrice, etc. Then start lifting weights and trying out vigorous exercise. Eat healthy too!

&#x200B;

Be creative, trust your thoughts and love yourself. It takes a long time to get out of a dark place, and your happiness all depends on how you can handle it. Make baby steps, but don't give in to your bad habits. They just lead you further into the dark place.",2,1561342474.0,t3_c44zo9,False

kl5og4,gh84kzz,None,"I will be honest, and I don't mean to downplay anything and I understand others are suffering immensely.

My life before Covid was exactly what others were experiencing during the lockdowns. I never went to school, I was homeschooled, so never had an opportunity to make many friends. Right before Covid I was living with my Jehovah's Witness grandfather and wasn't permitted to have friends outside of the religion, and since I wasn't practicing anymore I had no friends in the religion either.

I worked from home, I was lonely and bored all the time. Every day was spent in my room, working 6-8 hours then playing games, reading, writing, or listening to music until it was time to sleep, then I started again. On weekends I had no idea what to do with myself and mostly just talked to the few friends I do have on the phone or attempted to arrange plans to go out which ""sometimes"" succeeded.

I was so fucking depressed constantly and when Covid hit the only change in my life was now I had to wear a mask when I went out once a week to go food shopping. Honestly it felt like a great equalizer, and I felt like I finally related to the majority of people.

Among Covid, I ended up meeting a guy online. We did some virtual dates and eventually we took a leap of faith and met in person. We fell in love, and we are getting an apartment together in 4 days.

We have had some bumps I won't go into but honestly I have never been happier. I have friends now thanks to his introducing me to them and coaxing me out of my shell. I have hobbies, I enjoy my job now because it's not the only thing in my life to give me meaning anymore.

I know the pandemic is tearing people apart and I primarily blame the government for that, in particular I show sympathy for the small businesses and owners who are totally losing their livelihoods right now (its why my biggest mantra is ""shop small"") but I am tired of walking on eggshells when I say I don't relate to the worldwide depression. That's not to say I don't empathize and I do feel sadness when I hear of family who have lost multiple family members due to complications from the virus, I myself lost one of my few friends to suicide during the lockdowns, he already struggled with depression and not being able to play his music in public anymore was the straw that broke the camel's back, so I get it, I do.

And some part of me does feel bad that for the most part my life has largely improved this year. I'm sure I'm not the only one, but I won't feel bad for being happy for once in my life.",8,1609106397.0,t3_kl5og4,False

s7qmh6,htbvgk7,rockefeller22,"Great job OP! If anybody is struggling to save I have a few tips:

1) Set up auto-transfer to a savings account from your checking account that coincides with your income. It does not matter the amount, it will add up over time. If you can't figure out how much, see step two. The auto-transfer makes it happen for you, and you live off whats in your checking account. Do not even look at it.

2) Budget. Sit your ass down for 30 minutes and go through how much you're spending by category. [Mint.com](https://Mint.com) is free and does 90% of this for you. A monthly budget will expose where your money is leaking out. ""Holy crap I'm spending $600/mo on restaurants??"" - me.

3) It is TOTALLY ok not to have a plan for your savings account. Its there for emergencies and eventually retirement. You don't have to be saving to by a thing.

Threats (attention seeking) can be seen in personality disorders, and that in itself, is a pattern of maladaptive traits/patterns.

So fatso let me pick her up, which was rare since her butt usually hurt. But she made worried chicken noises and didn't even fidget.

fmfscq,fl4yl0d,purplepluppy,"I 100% understand why you feel that way. A lot of people do, and get very angry about it. I used to be very guilty of this myself, and often catch myself slipping into those thoughts.

Mental illness manifests differently in everyone. And because there are so many different kinds, it's impossible to compare one person's illness to another. Not to mention that chronic and reactive mental illnesses are often conflated. Sometimes social figures will talk about how they ""cured"" their depression, thinking anyone else could do the same, when in reality they found the solution that works for them and their reactive depression rather than understanding that not all depressions are the same.

So what I want to say to you is that you are handling your mental illness the best you can, and that's good. Other people are handling theirs the best they can, and that's good. Whether or not one person appears more successful than another is irrelevant, because each person is going through their own journey. Comparing our struggles only hurts everyone in the community. Now this may sound rational, but you already know it is hard to implement. Emotions are irrational in nature, and it is human nature to compare ourselves to others. Here's the thing - what one person experiences may objectively be worse than what another does, but if what that second person is going through is the worst thing they've experienced, that is the only reference they have. It may be the worst pain they've ever experienced, so to them it is severe.

Just remember that your feelings, your illness, and your struggles are valid. When it comes to your mental health, nobody else's matters.

fmfscq,fl5nnno,None,"I personally feel this way ALL THE TIME about my friends who are more successful than I am while living with similar diagnoses. But I also know intellectually that some people probably look at me and feel the same way. 

You know there is the social media cliche about comparing people's behind-the-scenes footage to your highlight reel. But it's true. People tend to be public about their successes and private about their failures. For example, you might see that someone else with ADHD has a good job, but you don't see their performance reviews, the constant reminders they get in their inbox about late documentation, the humiliation they feel whenever their boss has to remind them AGAIN to do something their other coworkers are all doing on autopilot by now. You might see that your friend with depression graduated from college, but you don't see how many hours spent crying in their advisors' office, begging for extensions, and swallowing the shame of having to tell their professors about their mental illness in order to earn some leniency, went into them squeaking through with that degree. You might see that someone has a serious relationship, but not all the ways they jeopardized that relationship before they made the difficult, life-upending decision to stop self-medicating and get sober... etc. etc. 

I do want to push back against the idea that people who seem to be ""living well"" with their mental illness are not actually mentally ill, or are just claiming it as some sort of fad, or have not had serious struggles, or just have a ""mild"" diagnosis, or must be self-diagnosed. Many of the most successful people I know have survived suicide attempts and multiple hospitalizations. I was just diagnosed with ADD and Bipolar Disorder, after about ten years of only being treated for depression (so I'm on meds and they help some, but I probably need to be on more/different ones and a lot of issues have persisted.) I'm more than halfway through graduate school. But all the examples in the last paragraph, if you hadn't guessed, were about me. 

I do really strongly encourage that people with mental illness who are living well or who appear successful, should be more transparent about the process. A lot of people think they are being transparent when they say ""I have X Diagnosis but look, I'm doing well,"" but I actually agree that this can be demoralizing and discouraging for people who are really seriously struggling. I try my best to be open about the ugly parts too. I never hide the fact that it was through the kindness and understanding of many people at my school who were knowledgeable and gracious about my mental illness, that I graduated with a BA. I could not have ""powered through it"" without help. I would urge anyone living successfully with MI to really shout out all the ways that they've gotten where they are by asking for help -- not just going to therapy, but all the times they've had to ask for patience and understanding from people around them, and all the times they've relied on that slack to remain where they are.",7,1584841114.0,t3_fmfscq,False
fmfscq,fl4f31l,TravelbugRunner,"For me they don't accurately depict or represent people in the community. 

The vast majority of people with mental health issues are not what most people would consider successful and functional. A huge portion of us are constantly running back in forth between hospitalizations and struggling to hold down a low wage job that doesn't give two shits about your mental health issues. And there are many of us who are so sick we can't hold down a job, go to college, or function so we either wind up having to live with our parents, some friends, or we run the risk of being forced into homelessness. 

This isn't a quarkie personality trait that doesn't impair your ability to function in life. Mental illness is an actual illness and a disability and I wish we could get people to jump off the ""Mental Health band wagon"" already. Mental illness shouldn't be a cool, edgy, trend for people to exploit.

&nbsp;

I suffered from trauma and depression from an abusive marriage which I ended back in November. Even after ending it, the trauma and depression still stayed. Days kept feeling lonelier and worse. I had to resort to drugs just for the social aspect of it and so that I can avoid feeling depressed. Soon after, I started dating a girl I met on tinder. I found genuine happiness when I was with her. Never found the need for drugs, etc. She used to spend days and night over at my place which fully helped with my loneliness and not once did I ever feel depressed. Almost a month into the relationship, she starts acting all aloof, stops coming over, doesn't reply etc. I got back into depression and then hit my plug up for drugs just to not feel depressed. Plug never showed up and I had to cry myself to sleep (No one in my IRL knew about my depression or my trauma and the extents I went to combat it. I managed to pretend that I had a very good mental health and didn't even bother getting counselling). The next day, the girl I've been dating asked to come over and I was overjoyed. The following day she broke up with me citing her own mental health to be the reason. Though I tried to be understanding, this break up spiraled me down into so much depression, I couldn't even function as a human being. That's when I decided not to pretend anymore and accept my mental health the way it is.

&nbsp;

Ever since I accepted my poor mental health, I stopped using drugs, started seeing a counselor, hired a life coach, sought help from friends from College, told my family of my disease. Sharing it actually kinda helped me cope up with it. I sometimes went on emotional rants on Reddit (and delete soon after) mainly about my struggle to get over that girl I've dated who made me feel extremely happy for about a month, since it was my way of venting it out. I've dated quite a few girls ever since, hoping to get that same feeling but couldn't and had to end them all. Decided to stay single and it kinda is working out well for me. I got over my ex as soon as I knew that she has a new boyfriend. Which also made me feel happy for her since she recovered from her depression.

&nbsp;

I was a coward to admit that I had poor mental health and kept pretending to myself and to the society that I had a very good/stable mental health. I realized I was not only negatively affecting myself, I was even negatively affecting others around me. I just wish I could apologize to everyone who have seen me pretend to be the person I was not!

First, please consider therapy. Your self esteem has been heavily affected and yes, therapy can and does help that.

Next, men have very screwed up ideas about what women want in a partner.  A survey of 64,000 women was done asking what they want in a partner. https://nypost.com/2019/07/24/this-is-the-no-1-thing-64000-women-want-from-a-lover-survey/

The number one thing - kindness.  

""Almost 90% of the women rank kindness highest among desirable qualities, followed closely by supportiveness at 86.5%. Intelligence received about 72% of the vote; level of education had 64.5%; and rounding out the Top 5 is confidence, with a little over 60%.""

Notice that none of the top five involve physical attributes. 

In fact, when women are asked about penis preferences, very very very few answer that they want anything over average.  There's a lot of reasons for that. For most of us, large pensises are actually painful during sex.  That area down there is not infinitely stretchable, not to mention there's organs completely surrounding the vagina.  

So where do people get this concept that women always want huge penises? Porn.  Not even kidding a little bit here.  The overwhelming majority of porn is produced for male fantasy.  What women want rarely comes into the picture. Men fantasize about being massive down there.  So porn utilizes that fantasy.

But porn has about as much relation to real sex and relationships as high school musical does to actual schooling.  So holding on to the fantasies put out in porn doesn't help you. It's actually hurting you.

Even worse, my own mother not only shamed me for having PTSD she ignored professional referrals and hired a bunch of quack shrinks to further fuck with my mind. At least you know you have an issue. I was made to drink the kool-aide and went 35 years pretending everything was okay. Smh

The trauma is real. So is the negligence and the emotional abuse perpetrated by your parents. I have gone no contact for these same reasons. Every so often my mother will try to contact me and attempt to lure me back to crazytown. I tell her we cannot have a relationship because she refuses to be responsible for anything. It's impossuble to trust somebody who cannot tell the truth, and show accountability, and there can be no relationship without a basic foundation of trust.

You got to understand, these people in your familybare even more fucked up than you or me. They live in a permanent state of denial and will concoct lies upon lies anytime their manufactured little reality is threatened. It's an illness, don't take it too personal. It's not about you or your value as a person. Even if you weren't abused, they would still find reasons to treat you like shit and make you miserable. That's their aim. It gives them their feelings of superiority they crave. You're never going to change that.

I stongly suggest you walk away. Seek a trauma informed therapist if you haven't already. Do not fall for guilt trips or other mind games. Use the same narrative with them: You cannot be honest with me. You dismiss my feelings and lie about your involvement in my abuse. You made a choice every single day to neglect me and you still cannot allow yourself to extend an ounce of compassion. 

The narrative is for you, not them. It's an anti-gaslighting device that helps you remeber why you are forced to do what you're doing to keep away. Plus, it easily sums up the problem so they can understand why they have lost your trust. Of course, your mother will die before she admits that any of this is true. But deep down in her heart she knows all of it is true. That's the reason for the indignation and outrage.

jp6m2x,gbditbz,TheAdlerian,"Stop talking to your parents.

That is the general point of view from the therapy world.

There is something wrong with them. Their answer to abuse is----more abuse. That makes no sense.

Probably, they were abused in some way and that is sad but when YOUR abuse turns into abuse towards OTHERS then you are now the bad guy. If your mom replies sarcastically and blows you off, then she is still in ""bad person"" mode and hasn't changed.

SO...your parents will keep abusing you in whatever way they can. It doesn't matter if they mean it or not.

People like that are ""toxic"" meaning like a walking disease. Just like today with corona we ""quarantine"" people and we ""distance"" from them.

My recommendation is to stop talking to them, but if you don't feel good about that, then ""Socially distance"" or what I call ""Loving From a Distance"".

Stopping communication is so that no new mental illness thoughts can get downloaded from them to you. Loving from a distance is where you wish them well, but don't really see them and if you talk, it's about the weather, etc. You do not ask questions or want to hear their thoughts on anything but surface topics.

I am telling you right now whatever dentist told you that they have to remove all of your teeth are lazy asses who can't be bothered to fix them so would rather just pull them, and they can make more money charging for extractions than to take the time filling them.

Teeth are always able to be saved, the only reason to pull a tooth is if it is that badly infected that you would need a specialist to perform root canal which you aren't able to afford. 

I highly doubt that as a 17 year old all of your 32 teeth are infected and need removing. I have never seen that in one single person, never mind a teenager. What I have seen?? Lazy dentists, time is money for them, I'm telling you right now that dentist has looked into your mouth, seen a 17 year who needs a lot of work doing and who has not taken care of their teeth and decided it is not worth the work. 

Go to another dentist please, or even look around at dental schools with students who are training, you would make a great case for their assignments. 

Having to wear full dentures will be the biggest regret of your life. They are not comfortable, over time without having teeth your bone that the dentures sit on will receed and you'll be unable to get a good fit, you will not be able to eat the foods you love. Partial dentures are not so bad, since you will have teeth remaining that hold the dentures in place. 

My fiance had this exact thing happen to him before we met, it was his biggest insecurity and biggest regret to the point it would bring a grown man to tears on a regular basis.

If you like you can ask the dentist to send you the xrays (if they didn't take any then that's a huge red flag), get a copy of them and message me and send them over. I can tell you what can and can't be done.",11,1597946720.0,t3_id5h4l,False

Trying to change someone can be construed as not loving them as they are, which leads to them hating themselves for their issues.

Be supportive. Be her shoulder to lean on. If she has issues, let her explain them and do your best to understand.

For instance, I sometimes get very moody because of my medication and I can‚Äôt stay up very late because I get way more suicidal late at night. That‚Äôs a tame example, but it still works.

I have chronic depression, anxiety and am in recovery from an eating disorder. My husband has hypochondria, PTSD, anxiety and suicidal ideation. We are no strangers to the situation you're in. 

First things first: you are her support person and teammate - you ARE NOT her therapist. You do not have the training to be one. Please, please, please talk to her about starting to see someone. You can only help someone who is willing to help themselves. 

Next, don't try to solve problems for her. Ask a lot of questions. What caused you to feel this way? Is there anything I can do for you right now? What would help you the most today? Etc. The more you learn about how these cycles work and the emotions she's feelings, the better you'll be at reacting in the moment. 

Sometimes just be a shoulder to cry on. It's all you can do. Depression fucking sucks and we're miserable sometimes. Just having someone BE there is a game changer.  

If this is a consistent thing, you could create a ranking system 1-5. Ask her in the morning how she's feeling. 1 is as great as it gets, 5 is the worse it gets. That will help you know what's going on and how to help. 

I can't stress enough that she should start seeing a professional, and possibly start medication if that's the right move for her (it was for me). However, suggest these things gently. Don't make her feel like something is ""wrong"" with her. Simply explain that you love and support her, but don't think you're well equipped in this area. Be there every day after therapy to talk if she wants to. üíï

Feel free to DM me if you want to talk. I know how it is. Thank you for asking and caring, the world needs more people like you to love people like me. :)",25,1596567168.0,t3_i3nuq2,False

I don't know how to help but I can list some things my boyfriend did for me during my anxiety attacks that helped me calm down. 

1. He just listened to me rant and reassured me that everything will be okay
2. Did small things to make my life easier (cooking a meal for me so I wouldn't forget to eat, helping me organize my room - it got really dirty during depressive episodes, planning stuff early in the morning so I wouldn't sleep all day).  Depression tends to have a lot of physical symptoms as well like oversleeping, loss of appetite, lack of motivation. 
3. After I said I wanted to go to therapy he found resources and woke up early with me to make sure I went through with it and called them. 

I also would advise against telling her to change or giving to much advice. Sometimes it's hard for people going through depression/anxiety to feel like they have to change something about themselves. It might make her feel like there's something wrong with her.

A puzzle,watercolor project, drawing, maybe each other- because the laughter and silliness you both will experience together allows the brain to tap into the emotional control center. Art and coloring especially have neurological benefits to calm the mind and soothe the body. Afterwards you can maybe explore those feelings together.

 Things that he did that helped:

‚Ä¢ Listened without judgement 

‚Ä¢ Always reminded me that he was here for me

‚Ä¢ Always reminded me that there was no rush in life and I could take all the time I needed to heal

‚Ä¢ Cooked dinner/did chores when I was too anxious to leave the room

‚Ä¢ Hugged me and sat with me through panic episodes 

‚Ä¢ Understood that i was struggling and never made me feel bad about napping all day, not doing anything

‚Ä¢ Tried to subtly put happier thoughts in my head and telling me options to feel better. (Which was annoying at the time but helped eventually.)

‚Ä¢ He was just there for me. Ever without the answers, even when he didn't understand. He never walked away from me in my darkest hours until I found the strength to try and pick myself up again.

LOOK AFTER YOURSELF 


Get comfortable with telling her off for bad behaviour or treatment of others (depression and anxiety can manifest as anger or nastiness) - with compassion, of course. Unfortunately, the more we get away with giving in to those urges, the harder it gets to stop.

Don't take the full load. Mental illness is heavy shit, and you can't carry her all on your own. Encourage her to speak to others about it and to develop a wider support network. This could include her family, friends, or a regular therapist.

You need a support network too. Don't be afraid to reach out when things get tough for you.

Remember that it's ok to say no. After a tough day it can be hard coming home and having to take on your part-time role as a counsellor. Sometimes you need a break.

The healthier and happier you are, the better you can support her.

Ask questions. Ask her what she needs from you.",3,1596582632.0,t3_i3nuq2,False

f2jkuf,fhcyxpt,None,"For multiple reasons. It also depends on the severity of your mental health issues. For example, if someone has unregulated bipolar, that's very difficult to deal with. When two people with mental health issues are in a relationship, that also causes problems. 

Relationships are difficult, period - because, as humans, we're innately flawed. Under the best of circumstances, we can try to communicate effectively...but throw in daily stressors, poor sleep, mental health issues etc. and it becomes more difficult. 

I don't think it's fair to say you're going to hurt or burden another person purely because you have mental health issues - and, frankly, I find it offensive that someone would suggest that. Mental health problems are often a lifelong struggle - and to suggest that anyone dealing with them should somehow ""spare"" others and avoid relationships is complete nonsense. 

My personal advice, as someone who struggles with crippling social anxiety, depression etc., is to continue being open and upfront about your mental health issues - and to make a concerted effort to prioritize good communication in all your interpersonal relationships.

That - and don't listen to people who apparently think you should just sequester yourself in some fortress of solitude and live in isolation for the rest of your life. Seriously, what absolute hogwash. I'm sorry but that's just ignorant.",182,1581473789.0,t3_f2jkuf,False

f2jkuf,fhd7cer,None,"As someone with depression and anxiety, it can be very difficult, **sometimes** impossible, to maintain a healthy, mature relationship with mental health issues in the mix. 

I've been with my husband 3 years and my issues have caused some serious toxic vibes in the past. He accepts me and helps me how he can, but at the end of the day I'm the one who has to manage myself. People with mental health struggles usually have a tendency to end up relying on and/or being dependent on their partner, and that is not healthy. 

Not everyone is at a point in their life where they have figured out how to manage their mental health and in those cases, yes, it's not a great idea to be trying to handle a relationship on top of everything else. Friendships are one thing, but a committed romantic relationship is a whole other ballgame. 

Yes, you CAN date and have relationships if you want, no one can stop you, but unless you've learned to manage your mental health, it's going to be a bumpy road that possibly ends in heartbreak. 

No one is saying that it means you can NEVER date or have a relationship. MOST people with depression/anxiety (not referring to other more series health issues here) learn to manage it over time, if not eventually overcome it completely. And many people with more serious issues also eventually find healthy management. 

Relationships, to succeed, require 2 equally mature adults who are both able to manage themselves and their own lives independently. Who are able to openly communicate **everything** and take care of their own stuff.

Sometimes people realize they aren't actually compatible but sometimes they just realize the other party has issues they can't fix themselves. That's frustrating to live with so they break up. 

Personally I don't like the mindset of ""I'll tell them right away, so everything is fine"". First of all, people think they could handle it but will be wrong all the time. You can try your best but it will 100% affect the relationship. Prepare yourself to be broken up with a lot. Sure, it's not your fault, you told them, but who cares abt shit like that at the end of the day? Second, as someone who has no difficulties having a mentally ill partner, I'd absolutely start resenting you. You'd expect your partner to just live with you being difficult due to mental health issues but can't be arsed to seek treatment?

\---

To the actual question:

First and foremost get therapy. DBT, CBT, narrative therapy. Find someone who works with you and learn with them.

Fear is a tool; an emotion that (when working correctly) encourages **effective self-protective behaviours**.

A fear of men in general, especially one which is causing reactive behaviours as you describe, is not a useful fear. We can tell it isn't useful because the self-protective behaviours it's engendering in you (flinching when people walk past, affecting your dating life) are not *effective* at actually protecting you. They are doing more harm than good.

Most maladaptive behaviours were adaptive at some point in time. It is helpful to sit down with yourself, be compassionate and curious, and reflect back; what is it that's set these guard dogs off in your brain? Is it a bad experience that you've forgotten or are suppressing? Is it a bunch of small bad experiences adding up? Is it fear that other people are feeding you - are other people telling you to be afraid, congratulating you for being paranoid, telling you ""it's correct, you're right to be hurting your mental health like this, because the world is horrible and scary and people who aren't afraid are stupid""?

The world is about the safest it has ever been. I don't know your exact personal situation, but the chances are that of all your ancestors, you live the safest, healthiest, longest, most prosperous life. Violence, poverty, and crime are making slow but sure progress towards zero - there has never been a time when people had *less* need for fear. There is no objectively correct amount of fear, but insofar as fear serves a purpose you probably need less of it than anyone ever has.

We, however, live in a newly connected world where potent emotional contagions like fear and outrage are shoveled at us daily through our media, our social groups, and especially through unhealthy parasocial fora such as Reddit. Fearful people spread fear - think about that critically. They do not spread *risk assessment* or *understanding of danger*. Fearful people spread *fear*.

Your job, then, is to understand your fear, to respect what it is trying to achieve, but to quell your reactivity and instead cultivate healthy *responses* to that fear. The fear may diminish but probably not entirely. What you can control is how your fear affects your life.

When you feel this fear, take mental notes. What is it that has triggered the fear? What is it trying to achieve? Is this encouraging an **effective self-protective behaviour**? Be vulnerable with yourself, compassionate; be the friend or parent that you could be to someone else in this same situation.

Find and use a breathing or grounding exercise if your emotions are dysregulated. Google those if you don't know what they are.

Gently ignore people who try and tell you to be more fearful. They mean well, but they're telling you to be afraid because they, too, are being reactive rather than having a sober and considered response to their emotional state.",25,1698694518.0,t3_17jpydo,False

I want you to imagine for a a moment to begin with the end in mind. I was reading a book over quarantine called the 7 habits of highly succesful people. Its a self help book. And something they wrote was that you have to imagine you're life has come near its end.

After medication change after 2 weeks I had what I believe was a disassociated fugue.  It was scary as hell, thought god was talking to me and almost killed myself because of it.

Got off all my meds and was able to right myself but it took a couple weeks.  If you look up serotonin syndrome, this can cause these types of episodes when meds are combined or dosage changes.

For me it was a combination of being on adderall, lexapro, buspar and xanax for 3 years.  I felt like the meds were taking a back seat so I saw a shrink who took me off adderall, prescribed topomax and then increased the dosage of lexapro and buspar.  This was due to bipolar diagnosis.  

I later found out that mixing lexapro and buspar can cause serotonin syndrome and one of the side effect of topamax is suicidal thoughts.  It was rough coming back and was even paranoid for about a month that people were out to kill me.  So I was keeping my blinds drawn.

While these are both nice things I never understood how they were capable of ruining a celebration for someone- especially the celebration of YOU! Your life, your accomplishments, your uniqueness- simply existing is a feat of nature, we deserve to celebrate it

For me personally a birthday is a license to do whatever I most enjoy! Even if I have to organize it myself it‚Äôs extremely liberating 

Sometimes I most enjoy quiet seclusion with favorite foods and media, sometimes I like to spend it with a few select people whose company I enjoy

I hope you have a happy birthday! I can‚Äôt imagine the loss you‚Äôve been through and whatever emotions you are feeling right now are valid- you don‚Äôt have to suppress them you don‚Äôt have to be happy every holiday

But you should indulge in the little things we have to celebrate on our journey through space and time- what‚Äôs your favorite sweet? Favorite movie? Favorite book- indulge a little bit seek out the things in life worth celebrating and pursue them without remorse

Never thought I would have lost both parents when I was in my 30s. I go to the park on a sunny day and sit on a bench that overlooks the park. The warmth of the sun makes me feel like I‚Äôm getting a hug from beyond. I feel it gives me permission to cry and grieve which I seemingly have a tough time doing. 

The biggest realization I have had about losing your parents is that it doesn‚Äôt matter how old you are when it happens. The grief is all the same. I watched my father in law weep when he lost his 95 year old mother. Age doesn‚Äôt prepare us and doesn‚Äôt lessen the loss. I took comfort in that. 

I also look at grief as love. I miss my mom so damn much, and that‚Äôs because I loved her so much. It reaffirms how much I loved my Mom, and also brings me comfort that I can share that love with other family and friends. 

I feel alone at times too,(and I‚Äôm married with two kids), I have suffered from depression because I have felt that I‚Äôm no one‚Äôs number one. I‚Äôm learning how to love myself again. I would recommend seeing a therapist if you can. 

You aren‚Äôt alone, and you are and can be loved. Where that unconditional love was easy to come by from your parents you need learn how to generate that yourself. I hope you have close friends and extended family for a support network. I‚Äôm currently rebuilding mine.

While I myself haven‚Äôt lost a parent, I have felt what you are describing later in the paragraph. I have felt like life was empty, without purpose. I have felt like I was isolated from the world and the joy that others seemed to experience so easily. I have felt like no one could ever be proud of me. I have felt useless, like nothing I did mattered anyway. I have felt so detached that the only thing inside of me was constant sorrow beyond words. I try not to think about it, but when I do I can still remember the feeling in my heart, and the exhaustion of waking up everyday. It brings tears to my eyes even now. But there was a way out. There was a way to break free. Thinking about that also makes me want to cry, because the relief of no longer feeling helpless and futile was such a weight of my chest. The way it felt to breathe and be alive. Sometimes my friends and I will still make jokes about being tired and death but I often still remind myself of the privilege I have of waking up in the morning knowing who I am. A lot of people I know take that for granted. I never will. While I can‚Äôt guarantee that the things I did will work for you, I can share some things that hopefully help a little.
1. Get a therapist and be honest. I know it‚Äôs hard. Ultimately I‚Äôm not sure how much that helped, but do it anyway. 
2. Go outside. I know it‚Äôs stereotypical advice, but just go outside and breathe the air. Try to take walks in a forest/field if you can, away from the city.
3. Sad music is okay, but don‚Äôt overdue it. It WILL make you feel worse. Find songs that address sadness and struggle, but encourage you to look beyond that. I have some I can recommend if you want. 
4. Give yourself a second chance. I was lucky enough that I had a professor reach out to me after the semester was over and tell me I could basically redo/make up pretty much every assignment, including the midterm. Try to remind yourself that it‚Äôs okay to make mistakes and it‚Äôs NEVER too late to recover. It is NEVER too late to try.
5. Find a middle ground. Don‚Äôt be so easy on yourself that you accept less than your best. You have so much potential for more. You have the ability to put purpose in your own life, although it will never be easy. Also, don‚Äôt be so hard on yourself that you breakdown at one mistake. No one is perfect.
6. Remember that it doesn‚Äôt matter if there‚Äôs no one around to be proud/disappointed. YOU are the main character in your own story. Every main character struggles. Every main character feels alone. But this is YOUR story, and it‚Äôs not over. (Plus, I‚Äôm a real person and so are most if not all of the comments. Reddit is proud of you)
7. Take care of your body. Pay attention to what your eating, how much water you‚Äôre drinking, how much you‚Äôre sleeping. You probably won‚Äôt be able to do it all right all the time, but physical health is strongly tied to mental health, more than you probably realize. Take care of yourself. 
I don‚Äôt know if this will help you, but hopefully you can at least get a little bit of insight. I‚Äôm not a professional, but I do my best, because every person deserves to get better. I believe in you, and I‚Äôm not the only one.",9,1617046049.0,t3_mfpa1h,False

mw40z3,gvggtg9,crazymusicman,"I feel like a lot of what you talk about is not a, like, law of physics which dictates how life is, but rather consequences of the choices humanity makes.

People everywhere over the globe are 'angry' because they are in pain, they have been hurt. If they are depressed, it is because they see through the charade of modern life.

Life has not always been shit, though. Many anthropologist have consensus on the lifestyles of pre-agricultural societies as compared to, say, Europe during the period of colonization: longer lifespans, less gendered distinction (less gendered oppression), minimal hierarchies, nothing akin to warfare, fewer mental illnesses, greater diversity of diet and higher levels of fitness, longer lifespans, etc. *

The news is meant to make money, and ""if it bleed, it leads"" has proven to be a good way to make money. 

The structure of society is why jobs are difficult and people feel uneasy. The pandemic is also a consequence of modern life - some people (for instance former CDC director Robert Redfield) think the virus was accidentally released from a coronavirus research lab in Wuhan, and the global nature of trade is what has caused it to spread, and our lifestyles which prioritize producing profits for corporations over caring for ourselves and our loved ones have left us with bodies unable to combat the disease.

People like the folks you mentioned face their struggles (overwork) because of their position in the global economy - most of the world struggles immensely while a relatively few folks live in extreme wealth and splendor. If wealth was distributed evenly, every man woman and child would have about $100,000 of wealth - factoring in cohabitation, such a distribution would be very comfortable for us.

If people in positions of power actually acknowledged the statistics on mental health (or global poverty or hunger or pollution or resource use, etc.) they would have to admit the system is causing a public health crisis, and would therefore need to change the system. Because the global economic system takes priority over the lives of human beings, such statistics must be ignored or, as in the cases you bring up, hyper-individualized.

\* - this isn't to say we need to go back to the stone age. Highly mobile pre-agricultural societies did not face scarcity, because there was, in effect, an unlimited supply of land, animals, and plants at their disposal. What humanity needs to do is shift from our current system, which rewards scarcity with higher prices, to a system which (1) protects the Earth and is sustainable and (2) provides for the needs of every individual.

Edit - also, you can take an active role in making the world a better place. Educate yourself about systemic processes and how they cause harm, and try and do small local things (think global, act local) with care and compassion.",5,1619106979.0,t3_mw40z3,False

It's in our human nature to 'compare things' to make a logical decision. When it comes to social media, all of a sudden your lifestyle is the thing you compare to someone elses.. It doesn't even have to be a explicit thing to do, a conscious thing. Just looking at people who are happy whilst you're not can reinforce the latter. 

When it comes to other stuff, I myself, struggle with my future a lot. At school we're forced to decide early what we want, but after a study everything becomes too expensive without a job. Once started, you're stuck (unless you get different support or sacrifice a lot of years into another study). Let alone the student debt, the housemarket skyrocketing out of control with our loans not rising, job offers are getting more and more ridiculous in their claims (experience or paperwork)... all this and many more personal things all come together to... permanent sadness.

In some ways, it sounds like you may be experiencing some of those symptoms already, putting yourself in a cycle of restriction and obsession, compulsive eating followed by intense anxiety, and repeat. One of the most important parts going forward, is to break out of that cycle. And it‚Äôs really really really fucking hard. Harder than changing your diet or your exercise.

It did take a while (like 3-4 months) but it‚Äôs much better like that than just quickly losing a lot of weight in a short time cuz ur most likely gonna gain it all back. 

I also wouldn‚Äôt recommend doing strict diets cuz in my experience it just lead to an ed (which caused me to gain all that weight back and I had to lose it all again) because you‚Äôre depriving yourself of the food you want which will then lead to overeating and binging later, so I‚Äôd recommend practicing intuitive eating and moderation instead. So if you‚Äôre craving donuts then you can have one to satisfy your cravings (which stops the binging) along with a balanced diet ofc (i also underestimated the importance of protein).

Ofc there‚Äôs more to weightloss like being in a calorie deficit and counting calories (in a healthy way) but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend doing that at the start cuz it‚Äôs such a big jump and I could never stay consistent in the beginning until I got used to eating a normal amount.

17qz1i6,k8fy52m,Time_Lingonberry_510,"Long response.

I'll mention some things that you can follow if you want to have some results.

1. Food is everything. You can lose weight even if you don't exercise. But the trick is to adapt to an adequate eating style that works for you. You don't have to quit eating things that you enjoy as long as you don't overdo it. The minimum amount of calories you need is around 1200 for your metabolism but an average for an adult is around 1300 to 1600 and it totally depends on many things. You will have to teach yourself how to read portions and calories in the food you take. And you will have to cook your meals. You don't have to be super strict about the calories as long as you stay within range.

2. Don't eat things you don't like just because they are healthy. Look for things you like that are balanced. If you like fried chicken, you can look around for options like grilled, light bbq chicken. Or if you like noodles, include them in a few meals per week and in a decent portion. Don't think of this as a diet, it is an eating style. You can still eat things like ice cream or chips, just not every day or an entire bag. Eat slowly, and drink a lot of water! You will see sometimes you can feel hungry when you are just thirsty. 

3. Work for ways to make food work for you. You don't like spinach? Then what about green juice? Do you like sweets? What about sweet fruit like grapes and cherries? Substitute some things with other better options. It is not black and white.

4. When you reduce the amount of calories you consume, YOU WILL FEEL TIRED! And probably moody too haha. It will take a few weeks for your body to assimilate you are in calorie deficit and to start using your fat reserves for energy. Be patient and drink plenty of water. You don't have to start exercising during this adjusting period, that can come later. The important part is that you find eating habits that work for you and you are able to adapt it to your lifestyle.

5. When you decide to exercise, look for something you enjoy! Not everything is about gym. It helps a lot to built muscle and train specific part of your body. You can start walking somewhere, play a sport even if you are not good at it, find that that motivates you to go out and move. Maybe playing with friends, or looking at a nice scenery.

6. You will have to adjust your time around your workout. And don't start thinking you will be going everyday. Going at least once a week at the begging works. You will feel tired and will need time to adapt to your new routine.

Edit: also, go to therapy

As far as what you can to do overcome it, talk therapy is helpful, maybe even medication depending on the severity of your issues (could even be temporary to get you through a tough period), support groups online, but I would recommend CBT or cognitive behavioral therapy. It's all about reframing thoughts in a more rational manner so that we have less distressing emotions. I use it constantly and it's worked very well for me.

Now that I finally have a job and schedule that works for me things are so much better than when I was in the ""rat race"" doing things I didn't enjoy every day. One thing that helped me in those times was reserving a day or some of a day like Sundays to do anything I wanted (homework sometimes took up some of my day). 

Knowing there would be some relief in a week, a month, or a few years helped me get through the tough weeks. Find or plan something you can look forward to like a place of interest, a small staycation or vacation, visit someone you care about, or treat yourself to something.

Another tip, while mindlessly watching TV find another activity you can mindlessly do that would make you feel some sense of accomplishment. Even just 5 minutes of playing an instrument, learning a language, or doing a chore or hobby can give you a boost.

Some may say that your 20's are supposed to be some of the best times in your life and for some people that is true; if you're still living at home with your parents, don't have many real responsibilities, are earning money just to enjoy yourself etc.  Then there are those that aren't afforded such luxuries at a young age, who are thrown into responsibilities, having to pay their own way and work hard to get everything they have; sometimes the best time of their lives therefor come later in life when they can purchase a car or a house or go on a holiday or break away from debt.

So don't trouble yourself in thinking you have a limited amount of time in order to be happy.  Pace yourself, look after your health, be clear on what you want to achieve in life and acknowledge your small steps towards that as one's consistent efforts generally get one where they want to be in time.

It isn't strange that after a hard day of work you feel totally drowned. This is what capitalism does and it will keep doing this to you. If you wanna break away I recommend reading some leftist literature. It will allow you to understand the feelings you are feeling a bit better. 

I recommend you start a journey inwards you say you suffer from depression look for the reason why. Maybe you struggle with other mental health issues, go inside try to heal. Maybe you need to therapist for that or other people who can support you. There are tons of tools out there to help to heal and grow. Go look for them, research them, use them. Examples meditation, spirituality, psychedelic or go ask yourself the big questions. The unanswerable once but ask them anyways because you'll probably find out some stuff about yourself.

If you are hoping things just will get better after school, it won't. You'll only end up being more miserable because it didn't live up to your expectations. Happiness is a by product not a goal you can't do things in pursuit of happiness. Because happiness isn't a permanent state of being.

Capitalism sucks, the way most people live there life sucks. The american dream is a nightmare. If you want to live a fulfilling life don't chase it it won't make you happy.

What do you need to do to get there?

Then say to yourself that sure your situation ""right now"" is not fantastic, but it's a step you have to take to get you on your path.

n0yalf,gwafavo,pandalivinlost,"Having battled with depression since my early teens I know how difficult this particular battle is. At 30 I now have worked through to a different perspective.
Working through uni to get my degree was so hard and what made it worse is that my degree wasn't even for a life time goal. 

I did one because I was supposed to.
I got a job because I was supposed to.

I did a lot of things in the last 15 years that were what was expected of me. Some of them worked out alright some of them were a total shitshow and threw me into some of my toughest battles with depression I ever had to face.

But now I look at what do I want to do.
I have to have a job to pay the bills, that much is true. But I worked to find something that I enjoy. So that while working still uses a lot of spellslots. I don't hate it everyday. I hate it some days, and some days I have a great day surrounded by people who help lift me up.

It wasn't always that way, and it won't always be that way. But as others have said. This too shall pass.
I hope you find a job that doesn't suck everyday. That you can find the good things in it to help build up your confidence. I hope you find the support you need to help you fight the battles ahead of you  and I hope you are proud of how far you've come.

Same thing happened to me in high school. In fact, I dissociated for a year straight and this have a very murky memory of my last year and a half of high school. I even attempted suicide. Well, as close as you can get to attempting; I stopped myself before any real damage was done. 

ANYWHO. I felt the same way at first. I moved out to the city and ‚Äústarted over‚Äù. What friendships I had here initially quickly fell apart. I focused on school and work and made plenty of acquaintances, but I never felt anything specific towards them. My attitude towards friendship or companionship was apathetic at its best. I put on my social mask for college and work. At home I did nothing. I didn‚Äôt party or meet people. *I didn‚Äôt have a personality. Nothing excited me. Nothing was important*

I‚Äôll skip over the mess that ensued shortly thereafter, but I started therapy. I‚Äôve been in therapy for over two years now. I started working through all my mess. You know what I found out? I do have a personality. People do enjoy me, people think I‚Äôm funny and smart. Do I have a ton of friends? Nope, I have about 3 friends. 1 of them lives in my city and a human I genuinely enjoy spending time with. Do I still suck at making friends? Most definitely. But I don‚Äôt torment myself over it anymore.

There's a book by Steven Guise called Mini Habits, and he just wrote a new one called Elastic Habits (which I haven't read yet.) Basically the idea is you pick two or three daily goals that are so small you can't possibly fail to do them, which are tied to a larger outcome. One example he used in the book is that he wanted to be a person who goes to the gym regularly. So his mini habit was to do one push up per day, which he could do in bed if he was falling asleep and remembered he hadn't done it. So no matter what, he met his goal every day. Yay! And some days he would do 10 or 20 push ups and totally crush it. Eventually he changed the mini habit to ""change into gym clothes"", because if he was in his gym clothes, he was more likely to go to the gym.  Eventually, he became a regular gym goer, he looked forward to going, and he felt weird if he didn't go.  

All this is to say, it sounds like you are putting  pressure on yourself. Instead, you could (read the book) and then pick some mini habits to get you where you want to be.

I want to be one of those exceptionally strong elderly women one day - the ones who meditate and do yoga or dance, and are just suuuuper strong.

For example; when I want to calm down, I think about positive future plans - tidying the garden, what it will look like, what I want to do with various budgets - planning my next holiday, what I want to do and where I want to go, working out how I might afford it (one of those holidays too nearly 15 years to happen) - house improvement, cooking plans etc.

It took me a very long time to get used to planning ahead. It can still be difficult to look forward, but learning to do so has helped me a lot.

Planning something, looking forward to something good, and following through is amazing.

And I then have happy memories to think about, as well as positive day dreams.

All the best, mate.",8,1583217341.0,t3_fcpcez,False

Not to mention, you could've passed something on to your dad in his last days had you visited him, and ended up giving him less time, and then you'd be feeling the same guilt as you are now. Anxiety is a monster that takes hold of good people and makes them mistake it for a part of their identity.

Try different therapies, try different supplements or medications or self help techniques, just never stop trying. One day you will get past this burden, knowing that if it hadn't have been for your dad, you might not have had enough reason to tear this anxiety away from your mind. Needless to say I didn't know your dad, but you seem to really care for him, he must have been a good parent. Good parents would give up a few months with their child to allow them the opportunity to thrive for the rest of their life.

My grandpa went into a ward after his dementia got worse, and I didn‚Äôt visit him once. The man was my entire world, and I couldn‚Äôt bare to see him like that. At first I was also preoccupied with life - I‚Äôd just started college and moved out. Then a year went past and they told me he wasn‚Äôt himself anymore. I felt like I‚Äôd already mourned him before he went to the ward since he had lost so much of himself, so I tried to tell myself I didn‚Äôt have to go since I‚Äôd just be looking at a shell of who he once was. It killed me nearly every day for five years. Every time I drove past the hospital I‚Äôd break down and contemplate going inside. But I knew it would kill me. I couldn‚Äôt see him there and have the realization he was trapped in his body. I know what he would say - ‚Äújust take me out back and shoot me‚Äù. He was a strong, proud man; and if he‚Äôd had a chance before he lost his mind, he would have chosen death. Then, just last year, he finally passed away. It was a relief and also the most heartbreaking moment of my life. It wasn‚Äôt until I was at his funeral that people started telling me that he‚Äôd asked for me specifically in the beginning. He had moments of clarity where he would remember people. He asked people to help him escape for years. This fucking crushed me. I‚Äôm still dealing with the guilt. But I have to know in my heart that I did what I had to to keep my sanity. As selfish as that may seem - my grandpa would have wanted that for me. He wouldn‚Äôt have wanted me to be completely ruined and with the mental image of him like that burned into my skull forever. 

You can‚Äôt blame yourself, it doesn‚Äôt do any good for anyone. I‚Äôm sure your dad wouldn‚Äôt want you to suffer and he understands your reluctance. This happens a lot when it comes to death and sickness. We aren‚Äôt build to handle it well. Try to remember all the good memories you had with your dad and keep his spirit alive - that‚Äôs the best way you can honour him.

It‚Äôs validating and helps you realize the small victories that do add up. You shouldn‚Äôt feel guilt because we can‚Äôt change how anyone thinks or acts, we can only change ourselves. Your father sees the world through a much darker lens and it‚Äôs okay to feel sad that he isn‚Äôt experiencing happiness like you are, but there is nothing you can do to change that. Hopefully this incident will show him he needs to start making changes of his own and seek help. I think it is important to share with him how scary that situation was and how hurt you are; him killing himself wouldn‚Äôt make the world a better place, or take away his pain, it would scar you and transfer that hurt to you. All the bad days have passed and there‚Äôs so many days to come that are filled with opportunity, but only if he gets help. Of course things won‚Äôt get better if he doesn‚Äôt change, and it‚Äôs hard work and sometimes feels physically impossible but it can be done. All the future happiness and love is worth so much more than empty death. 

I am glad you have a bf that is there for you, I also know how having to consider someone else‚Äôs mental health when dumping your issues on them can be stressful. My bf is incredibly supportive and kind, but i feel guilty whenever i have breakdowns dealing with my family problems because it happened often as I deal with it everyday. I worried that i was emotionally draining him and it was affecting our relationship. It was emotionally draining and I want him to be my bf/partner/best friend/confidant, not my therapist who deals with my dark issues. I have been in therapy for about a month now and it has been great, my issues don‚Äôt follow me around all day like they did. It just does more than helping me deal with trauma, and keeps me from wanting to break the relationship because i have too much to handle. 

I really hope everything gets better and that your dad gets the help he really needs. You sound like a great and caring daughter and you will make it through these times. Whenever I am down, and my mind gets crowded with everything that is bad, i remind myself of a quote from Mr. Rogers that is basically ‚Äúall the bad things we‚Äôve experienced and all the good things, have made us the person we are today‚Äù it basically puts in perspective all the life lessons that have armed you with the ability to make it through hard time or be more compassionate or cautious.

I dealt with my addicted father pulling this type of stuff for many years before I had to walk away for my own mental health.

I found that idea so awful I made a lifelong decision to stop taking care of him and his problems and start taking care of myself so I‚Äôd never ever be this kind of burden on them. It hasn‚Äôt always been easy, I loved my father very much, but I had to decide to love  myself and my kids more. Don‚Äôt feel guilty for calling the police, and don‚Äôt let him try to make you feel that way either. You did the right thing - the kind and compassionate thing. I‚Äôm not advocating just blowing him off, that‚Äôs a decision we all must come to on our own, but I will say my life has been so much healthier and happier without worrying when that next crisis call would come and upend my own families lives. For the record I‚Äôm now 52 with 3 grown healthy daughters who never have to worry about such matters. They never knew him so they don‚Äôt miss him and tho I sometimes wish it could have been different I‚Äôm at peace with my decision.

Whether we have mental issue or not, we develop who we are based on what/how we do/think/(any verb). This allows us to make judgements in life that we are happy with. Judgements that aren‚Äôt controlled by outsiders. Like, you see a homeless person. Giving your money to that person is an example who you are. You can give your money or just walk past. 

Now, this sense of ‚Äúwho you are‚Äù get developed by your life experiences. Mixture of your own experiences, what you were taught, and what you observed in someone else‚Äôs experiences. 

The problem happens when those sources get off balanced or you develop weird reasons. 

I don‚Äôt know what your situation is, so I‚Äôll use my own example. 

Some of my issues are over-attachment and non-stop accommodation. 

Ever since I was young, I was forced to please others. Some of those suggestions are good, actually. Eg be polite to others. Don‚Äôt harm others. Etc.
However, that got little too much from time to time. Eg do not disobey elders. Do not fail. Do not disappoint us. Also, the punishments for those were abandonment and separation. That molded me into a person who is constantly looking out for ways to please others, because i was afraid to be abandoned. For example, i open myself too quickly and show vulnerability, and thus causing people to get overwhelmed by me. 

At the moment, I‚Äôm feeling the same ‚Äúi dont know who i am‚Äù, but for me, I‚Äôm feeling that because two reasons. 

1. My life has been evolving around other people in my life. I do things for others. I learn things for others. For example, I‚Äôm a good cook. I learned that to please my friends and SO. I rarely cook when I‚Äôm alone. I‚Äôm polite to people. However, I‚Äôm not that nice of a person. I‚Äôm grumpy and moody when I‚Äôm alone. This caused me to not knowing who I am as a person, if I remove ‚Äúother people‚Äù from the equation. My life has always been defined by others. 

2. My flaws got exposed. Now I know what‚Äôs wrong with me. My fundamental thought basis is flawed. I have developed my own set of rules of behaviors based on  that fundamental thought basis. But ever since I learned that the basis of my rules is flawed, I‚Äôm just lost on who I am, and what I‚Äôm just to do/think.",12,1558895326.0,t3_bt9kb9,False

she knows about my triggers, my delusions  and lets me be dramatic and emotionally volatile ... because she knows even if i dont see my own bullshit in the moment, i will surely acknowledge it later once my narcissistic rage has passed. im very lucky

but i am high intelligence and relatively high functioning, for an APD/NPD. most apds for instance are low intelligence and will never have much self awareness, and most NPDs will never accept or understand that the constant chaos in their lives and relationships are due to their own self-concern and emotional volatility.

so, i am fortunate to have some self awareness. however, i likely never would have gotten to this point of acceptance if it werent for a series of catastrophic consequences in my life. ive had some serious legal problems, very very serious relationship problems, have lost so many people, destroyed so many valuable relationships.. my poor decisions have resulted in others lives being very negatively affected.

Another thing. You might be alarmed or feel the urge to judge yourself for some of the thoughts you end up experiencing about the situation. ANY thought you have in response to this is an OK thought to have. None of them mean you're a bad person. None of them are too shocking or horrifying to share with a therapist and none of them say anything about you. This is really just another way of saying be kind to yourself, but sometimes after something traumatic like this people have a tendency to be horrified by the thoughts they have, and if they get stuck feeling horrified by those thoughts it makes healing a LOT harder.

Also, you found out about a skill you have: you have the ability to do what is needed in an emergency, respond to someone else's trauma with a clear mind -- this is a skill that sets you apart. This is a skill possessed by emergency medicine personnel, paramedics, firefighters, veterinarians, etc...

Then the heavy weightiness of the situation is assessed later... It's not in the moments that you're handling it...otherwise you and people in the above professions wouldn't be able to perform what is needed.

The difference is they have access to debriefing immediately and employees to discuss it with.

And has better long term outcomes and minimizes forming PTSD, (and compassion fatigue, and burnout if in jobs where you see painful things a lot)

A lot of research comes out of the helping professions mentioned earlier, along with adults and children in war zones. 


I've had similar experiences due to both my hobbies and previous line of work, and my location of work... I can tell you that talking openly about how fucked up something was and crying and just getting it out helps. Visuals haunted me. Right now, thinking about this, I am remembering some, but they don't hit the same, I don't see them in my head when I try to sleep etc. 

Oh, trying to fight them sometimes makes it worse. Trying not to think about it sometimes makes it worse. Our brains want to process stuff.

r0yuii,hlvv0xt,jesseverus,"Hey, I had a similar traumatic event (a fatal car accident, bad enough the engine was ripped clean from the car and a power pole was the only thing that prevented the car from coming through my house) that I was first on scene of some weeks ago, and like you, I was almost in shock when it happened and didn't feel much of anything at the time, except what I needed to do? Since then, it's been messing with my sleep a lot and I've been trying to make sense of it all. 

My recommendation? Seek counselling - it's trauma. Talking through it and working through those feelings is really important. I have my second session tomorrow after almost breaking in the first one. I keep trying to make sense of something that I don't think sense can be made of? Looking for answers that may not exist, but counselling is helping to cope with that. 

If you can't afford professional help (forgive me, I'm not sure on your circumstances), seek online support somewhere - it's important to work through this, rather than putting it in a box. Trauma can be incredibly damaging - I'm only now, at 33 years old, starting to work through mine.

15t62xg,jwiq017,redsaidfred,"Jealousy can be a helpful emotion if you know how to use it. First it informs you of what you want, and second it can motivate you to go out and get it. 

Unfortunately if you don‚Äôt process those feelings, sometimes you can get stuck in resentment towards your friend which can affect that relationship as well as consume you with bitterness and displaced anger. It can be helpful to talk with an unbiased person, perhaps a therapist, so you can explore these feelings and figure out how to move past this. 

Some questions you might want to ask yourself as you feel your feels:

- Are you really angry at your friend for his success? Or are you angry with yourself for not achieving success in your career? Or missed opportunities? Or unfair circumstances?

- Does your friend have any positive qualities to balance out the negative? Is the relationship valuable to you? There is a love & kindness meditation that can help you feel more compassion towards your friend, there are lots of free ones on YouTube.

- Do you know for sure that he is a multimillionaire? Maybe most of his money is tied up and invested in the business? Maybe he doesn‚Äôt have access to his money for awhile? Maybe he incurred a lot of debt to get there?

- Do you know what kind of success you want to bring into your life? Career? Influence? Wealth? If you can narrow down what is lacking in your life, you can brainstorm some ideas for making it happen. 

- What small goals can you set? What steps do you need to take to achieve those goals? Figuring out what you want in life and slowly moving towards the right direction can help you to feel a greater life satisfaction instead of ruminating on someone else‚Äôs success. 

Anyways I hope that you can explore your feelings and figure out a solution that works for you!

don't count another man's money, as the saying goes. I don't think you should equate the fact they raised money for their business with your friend's net worth or how much he has. that is a big fallacy about start-up entrepenurship. there's always a give and take. all kinds of factors that go into a company's valuation. It's important to understand that money isn't pocketed - it's strategically used by the business to grow revenue and valuation or maintaining operations and runway for long-term vision, like paying staff, etc. if they raised money, it's almost certainly in exchange for equity. it wasn't free. if his shares are vested (which I assume they are since you say he's a co-founder and has been at it for that long), he would have had to dilute his percentage in exchange for the company getting capital. also, in addition to his vested shares, I'm sure he's compensated with options. sometimes people in start-ups confuse options with shares given that they have vesting schedules. but they're just options to buy shares at a deeply discounted price at a later date or when the company gets acquired. I once was a part of a company that raised money and the whole nine yards.  I had a bunch of options. I thought, ""man, this is my golden ticket!"" A five years and a ton of hard work later, things didn't pan out for the company and the options were completely worthless.

I hope your friend's business is wildly successful! I also think there's a lot you can learn from your friend about business and entrepreneurship and, if you want what he has made for himself, think about how to apply it to your own life, in your own unique way.",2,1692248141.0,t3_15t62xg,False

avrl8k,ehh5k96,None,"Really, that's one of the reasons they are asking you. Sometimes we have thoughts and feelings and we just ASSUME they are real. We hold onto ideas and thoughts that are ridiculous, take them as gospel, and let them bring us down. We let emotions flood us and just accept them instead of trying to figure out what we're actually feeling and why. It's good that you are questioning yourself. It means you are trying to learn to be honest with yourself, which is hard for a lot of us. We assume we would never lie to ourselves. If I look in the mirror and tell myself I'm fat and worthless, it must be true because I know me better than anyone, right? Not necessarily. 

That other voice that is you, that criticizes and brings you down, it isn't REALLY you. You can acknowledge it, but you don't have to listen to it anymore than anyone else who is being an asshole to you. 

I'll tell you one thing that's really helped me over the years, as far as learning to not take that stuff so seriously. I started a journal when I was a teenager - decades ago - as an outlet for my thoughts and emotions. Eventually I started reading back through past entries. In the moment, things felt so huge and important, and in hindsight, they hardly made any difference at all. We often react to and over-analyze things that don't warrant it, and it's hard to see that except in hindsight. 

The therapist isn't laughing at you or criticizing you, trust me. They've heard it all. Their job is to bring things to the surface and get you to sort of remove yourself from stuff so you aren't just overwhelmed and drowing and lost in your thoughts and emotions, accepting them without question. Doubting yourself is not always a bad thing - it allows you to forge a path to self-improvement. ",40,1551364725.0,t3_avrl8k,False
avrl8k,ehhursz,JaqSmith,"I think it'd really help to stop thinking of your feelings as ""right"" or ""wrong"" or ""fake"". Feelings just are. If you experience the feeling; IT IS REAL. Just remember, a feeling can be real without also being a fact. IE ""I feel alone"" is not the same as ""I am alone"". It is a true and valid emotion to feel alone even if you are not literally alone.

It is an important first step to acknowledge what emotions pass through you without immediately trying to judge how reasonable they are. You can search for their sources and explore if they're worth holding onto or trying to change or redirect *after* you've let yourself notice them.

Sometimes it's the ""nonsensical"" emotions that tell us the most about ourselves.

If you feel yourself frequently flipping between different feelings/opinions/beliefs about certain subjects, that's super helpful to acknowledge too. That uncertainty is a valid feeling of its own. 

Understanding your mental health is all about openly and honestly admitting to yourself what your thoughts and feelings are from moment to moment, day to day, situation to situation. Try to non-judgementally gather the facts first, then look for patterns and connections that might help you untangle them.

TLDR: All feelings are real. It's never wrong to say ""I feel _______"" whether or not you think there is a ""good reason"" to feel that way. Start by accepting that you feel what you feel. Any good therapist should understand that feelings are nobody's choice or ""fault"".

avrl8k,ehhovhe,josski32,"I started trying to figure out my mental health for real about a year and a half ago, when I began college and left my parents' house. I would have tons of moments where I knew I was being insanely overly emotional, and I would just shove my emotions down. Like, my roommate would use my charger without asking and I would feel an intense, burning anger, and then end up never addressing the situation because I didn't want to risk overreacting. But this was the problem. I was used to shoving my emotions down because of the household I was raised in, and it sounds like you relate.

>""your mom would say you're being ridiculous right now.""

The answer for me was to acknowledge the type of anger I was feeling and acknowledge where it was coming from: partially from the actual situation (I was actually annoyed my roommate would use my things without asking) but also from my past. (Used to being ignored, used to being told my emotions were stupid, used to being invalidated constantly, used to not being taken seriously) Years and years of this type of emotional abuse had not only made me doubt my feelings, but made my feelings stronger and more intense since I constantly ignored them. So I think you are right to feel that your intense feelings are somewhat out of place. But I also think you need to acknowledge and respect them. Meditation can help a lot so you can detach from your feelings a bit and see what they are actually trying to tell you. At the same time, take yourself seriously. You and your feelings deserve to be taken seriously. The more you acknowledge your feelings in a constructive way, the less intense they will be, in my experience. I also have spent a lot of time writing down and speaking into my voice memos on my phone about my feelings, doing so can really give you some clarity and you can read/listen back at a later time to gauge whether or not your feelings were out of proportion. 

I hope this helps!! you deserve to be listened to and taken seriously. your feelings are valid, you are valid.

When I was about 20 years old, I had to get up early, go to work at a factory, where I'd work STANDING UP for 8 hours, go to college at night and still managed to cram entertainment into that hectic schedule (Ex: Went to concerts on weekdays, coming home at 3 in the morning, having to wake up at 6)...there was a time there that I even used to run all the way back home from work before going to college.  


But that was before depression hit me.  


Nowadays, I don't have the energy for anything, it seems. The mere thought of 20 year-old me doing all those things and not collapsing on the floor seems inconceivable. It's not because I'm older (I'm 37 now), because I know a lot of people who are my age who are very active and gung-ho about life, they do a lot of stuff and they're always motivated. It's the depression. It saps your strength and your will. You just want to go home and be alone. Those feelings were already there when I was younger, but I somehow managed to subdue them.

a0h2r6,eai30fa,brileighl,"Hello! I have severe anxiety and moderate depression, but I‚Äôm one of those people who get out of bed at 5am-6am, got to my 8am, work hard all day at school to maintain my 4.0, go to my first job till 9pm, then go home and work my second job (remote job) and finish my homework all while maintaining good family relations, a long term boyfriend, and a small friend group. 
I am definitely NOT trying to brag as my life isn‚Äôt perfect, but I want to share some tips on how I went from taking hours to drag myself out of bed to where I am now. 
Note: Everyone‚Äôs mental illness is different and unique, even if we call it by the same name. What helps me might not help you, but I hope it can. 

1. Make a list of goals for the future
Sounds dumb, but once I did this the reality of how short my time is hit me. I wrote down what I needed to do to achieve them, and it gave me a kick in the back of the knees but it helped me gain a better perspective. 

2. Focus on eliminating suicidal tendencies
If I‚Äôm suicidal, nothing happens. I don‚Äôt work, I don‚Äôt make an effort, and I basically give up. It doesn‚Äôt matter if I‚Äôm actively planning suicide or just feel the tendencies, I can‚Äôt be productive. It‚Äôs not realistic to expect yourself to just look in the mirror and say ‚ÄúStop being suicidal‚Äù. That‚Äôs not how mental illness works. However, whenever I‚Äôm feeling suicidal, I text 741741 ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù and they give me resources and tips to control my suicidal tendencies. It helped me learn how to manage them, and I haven‚Äôt attempted in over a year. I also use this for self harm impulses, and I‚Äôve been clean for 4 years. 

3. Find something you love
With depression, this can be hard because the things you used to love don‚Äôt interest you anymore. Before/during my lowest points I played video games, but as new waves of depression hit I stop playing them. However, now I love makeup and it gives me an outlet to express myself and put off some stress. 

4. Take care of yourself
Make it a point to take care of yourself. Take a shower, eat well, drink water, get some exercise if possible, put on a face mask, brush your hair, etc. This can all seem very useless and menial when you‚Äôre depressed, but trust me if your body feels good your mental state will improve and feel it too. 

5. Ask yourself primarily- what motivates me?
For me, it‚Äôs my boyfriend and the prospect of our future life together. It motivate me to push myself and to be the best I could be for myself and him. For my sister, it‚Äôs to make the best life for her dog and future dogs. For some, it‚Äôs friends or family. Find what motivates you and always have it in mind when you feel like giving up. 

This, of course, is just my advice, but it was life changing for me, and I hope it helps you. ",44,1543241490.0,t3_a0h2r6,False

This is the third time it's happened because my insurance can't freaking get that I use Walgreens as my pharmacy, not the one I was previously using because it closed (waaaay before all this happened btw, it's been four months...).

So I either pay $51 for this medication that helps me not want to hurt myself, or...what? Plus they'll upcharge me if I refill it too early. Oh, you have two days left of this script? Okay refill it and wait 24hrs. It's only $1.50. Wait you refilled it with *five days left*??? $7.80. I have a life and sometimes it get busy and I just want the security that I have my meds when they run out. Not take my last pill and then run to refill it. 

I hate this and I hate how I'm treated by customer service when I call to get things fixed. Something I gotta do tomorrow now because they are only open from 9am to 5pm...but watch. I'll be on hold for two hours and then told bullshit lies because they don't want to do their jobs.

Then I had the chance to visit France for a summer because my uncle moved there for work and suddenly I discovered some things were different somewhere else. 

I made it a goal to live somewhere else for a bit. Don't assume  I have money or anything or that I dropped everything and went out hitchhiking. I was going to college and working full time. I just made it a goal, and took me a couple years to raise the money for an exchange program, but I did it. 

Almost 10 years later I've been living in Chicago for 5 years, which I fell in love with, and this is my kind of place. Here I fit and I (slowly, with work and patience) am molding my life to what my goals are.

We go to the dentist twice a year for checkups because they schedule you for them, even if nothing is wrong. If we have an issue we just call and make an appointment. We bring kids for appointments early so they can have an early start, build good habits, and not be afraid of the place. I can easily leave work saying ‚ÄúI have a dentist appointment‚Äù without stigma. Not sure about insurance but in Canada dental care is commonly covered.

bv2l61,epnfj29,LadybirdTheCat,"Mental health care is inaccessible largely due to a gross lack of oversight of a major law. According to the law, mental health MUST be covered by insurance. Equal access to mental health and addiction treatment services is your right! The 2008 Federal Parity Law requires insurers to cover illnesses of the brain, such as depression or addiction, no more restrictively than illnesses of the body, such as diabetes or cancer. This law was signed in by President Bush and later expanded by President Obama. Many states also have their own, stronger parity laws.

*Your insurance provider is in violation of the law and needs to be reported. Your best bet is contacting your state insurance commissioner. By doing this you may be able to have your insurance provider cover an out-of-network therapist at in-network rates!*

Now here's the issue, due to the lack of oversight, most insurance providers simply ignore the law. And they get away with it every single day.

This news report does an awesome job explaining the issue: [Parity Complications Harming Patients](https://www.newsy.com/stories/how-mental-health-parity-complications-are-hurting-patients/) 

Here are a few signs that your plan may be violating Federal Parity, from the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI):

* Higher costs or fewer visits for mental health services than for other kinds of health care.
* Having to call and get permission to get mental health care covered, but not for other types of health care.
* Getting denied mental health services because they were not considered ‚Äúmedically necessary,‚Äù but the plan does not answer a request for the medical necessity criteria they use.
* Inability to find any in-network mental health providers that are taking new patients, but can for other health care.
* The plan will not cover residential mental health or substance use treatment or intensive outpatient care, but they do for other health conditions.

The only way we will be able to create change in this country is if our voices become loud enough. If you're currently being denied care, know of someone who is being denied care, or if you've experienced this in the past 11 years since the law was enacted - let your representatives know!

When you are in a social dynamic with a person and then they verbally punch you in the face, it feels like whiplash. No one has natural intuition on what to do next. I mean, we were just... you were just telling me about your marriage... we were eating breakfast with each other... what do I do with this situation? I'm not in fight mode, I'm in social mode. I'm supposed to hit you now?

It takes practice (meaning, multiple times hearing racist comments from people who were just acting friendly toward you) to get the hang of how to transition from social to fight mode. ""Why would you say that? That's a really ignorant thing to say."" Etc etc. 

I don't think just leaving was the worst thing to do, either. You know what's worse? Playing along, pretending like they didn't say that, trying to stay friends... ugh. Ask me how I know.

My advice is to grab on to the situations where you open your laptop with the intention to work. That alone is a huge and valuable initiative. 

In order to prevent the initiative from fizzing out, do this simple trick:

As soon as you become aware that your progress is halting(‚Äúend up staring at my screen‚Äù), switch immediately to another (empty) document, and start typing the following phrase: ‚ÄúI have nothing to say.‚Äù  
Keep repeating this unsophisticated sentence continually. After some time your brain will break that rhythm and shift your thoughts away from the sentence. Use that spark to continue on your task. Keep going back to writing that one simple sentence whenever your flow stops

I get so discouraged and so hopeless/despairing. When I decided to see a counselor again recently, I abandoned it after 3 appointments because he was giving me the most useless advice. *Oh, use my phone calendar?* Omg, that‚Äôs groundbreaking. I‚Äôve never thought about that before!!!!!!!!!!!!

There is no sugar coating it. You are going through hell right now, but the only way through it is through. Try to eat, and keep hydrated. Don‚Äôt feel guilty about sleeping and full bed days.

I know how damaging it is to be exposed to sex and sexual experiences and information too young.

(I don‚Äôt like saying sexually abused because the other person was a kid too who probably learned the same way) but I (m) played with a kid across the road from my grandparents (m) I was maybe 5, he was probably 7. He touched me, made me touch him and do other sexual stuff (blowjob, anilingus) 

I remember pleasure I think, but the biggest scarring factor for me was I went on to instigate homosexual acts with friends in my age group as o thought it was normal (meaning sex acts between young kids obviously being gay is normal)

And then through my teen years I was called a gay or a faggot behind my back and it took me many years to get away from the bullying of it. So not only was I sexually abused I was also socially and mentally abused afterwards.

This also instilled a deep dark pit of hyper sexuality and porn use that I still have to keep under control in my adult life.

&#x200B;

I was a social dumbass straight out of highschool due to my upbringing as well, so I can relate. What helped me get out of it was going to a very small (\~400 people) college and finding my group, literally just a few friends. They really helped me feel less alone, improved my confidence, taught me how to behave around people (sometimes literally), and taught me how to even talk to girls. I've done and said some really STUPID shit (like giving a back-hand compliment to one girl that basically implied she was fat, because I didn't even realize this implication), but they helped me realize why it was stupid and how not to do that.

Ironically most of my close friends from that period WERE women. Even today, I find myself oddly comfortable around girls. Not in a sleazy way, just in a total ""friendzoned"" way (which I kind of like, since there is no pressure to hit on them or have any ulterior motives).

I donno, maybe it's something about women being more empathetic and emotional than men (hooray gender stereotypes!) but they made me feel safe and took care of me. I also never had any romantic interest in them nor tried to hit on them (which also made them comfortable around me).

&#x200B;

So my story is probably totally anecdotal, but I wanted to share what helped me get out of my ""forever-alone"" shell. I might have just gotten lucky (my school was a small, tightly-knit, 70% female community), but maybe it's a model worth following? See if there's any group like that you can find (friends, classes, clubs, or even a support group). Try **googling Social Anxiety Support Groups in your city** maybe?

I'd avoid online communities TBH. Yeah, they CAN be helpful, but there's also a dangerous risk of them being a toxic echo-chamber (such as the incel forums you mentioned). I used to browse all the mentalhealth, depression, anxiety, etc. subreddits, but I stopped because they focused on catastrophizing and indulging each others' misery, rather than moving past it.

Im sure a good step you should take is ignore anything related to that bullshit mindset entirely. Including posts judging it. Your mentality is transformed by what you feed your mind.

18d8al1,kcftppv,signal_red,"You're not a monster. You were a child. A literal child whose brain has barely developed. As a child we do a lot of experimenting, and we definitely do a lot of sexual experimenting. I don't think many people talk about this, but it's more common than you think. And it's not intended to be nasty or dark...it's just kids trying to find things out about themselves & each other.

there was a case with the actress Lena Dunham a few years (yikes maybe 10 years ago omg am i that old) where she wrote in her autobiography about a moment in her childhood where she did what some people considered sexual assault on her sister. I think they were both under 10, possibly even younger. I won't repeat what she did to her sister, but she clarified that what happened was not okay but made it clear *she was a child* when this happened and as kids, we do some crazy things. I only bring this up because she said she talked to her sister about it, and her sister did not have an issue with it. That's making me think of your sister who doesn't seem really to have that much of an issue or at least it doesn't seem like you caused her any trauma.

you're not a child molester. You can only be that if you did this if you're over 18. I think you're definitely embarrassed (I don't think you need to be). Also I don't think your parents really have a right to feel any kind of way about this considering as a minor you should have been under their watch

Thirdly I would reach out for professional help for both yourself personally and maybe even a family therapist that could mediate the group so nothing escalates in a way that isn't constructive.

An adult understands that their actions are inappropriate and wrong, which is what makes their behavior exploitative. A child has far less awareness for the consequences and impact - especially sexual actions. Which is why we don't expose children to sexual content. 

A 9 year old is not a ""child molester"" (since they are quite literally a child themselves). Also, I think it's important to determine the reason for such actions - why did you behave that way?

Basically, it's a sub for children of parents that display emotional abuse. And just from what you are describing, I think you would find a lot of similarities with the stories posted there. 

Your family does not care about how you feel, you seem to often be their last thought in every situation. That's not normal family life. That's really shitty. You are not being overly emotional. You have emotions like everyone else, but they tell you things that makes you feel like you're somehow in the wrong.

sekh5r,hukygc5,DrDawnEliseSnipes,"Guilt is anger at yourself.  Anger is a basic emotion that tells you there might be a threat.  Often when we feel guilty about something it represents something we did or did not do that went against our core values and we fear the consequences. An important point here is that your actions were NOT intentional.  You were ""blissfully unaware that what you thought was the right thing or at least that you did your best, truly wasn't""

Guilt can be good if you truly did something wrong and it motivates you to change your behavior, but as Just-A-Guy said below, what is done is done.  Now that you are aware you can make amends if appropriate and start being the person you thought you were to begin with. It totally sucks to have that realization, but you do have the ability to learn from the past and not repeat it.  I work with people every day who are in recovery and have turned their lives around.

The people you impacted have the responsibility of forgiveness.  If they want to stay angry, that is on them.  Or, they can accept the past and your apologies.  Set boundaries to protect themselves from it happening again, while also giving you the opportunity to show them how you can grow.   

I really like the way book Atomic Habits encourages people to change their mindset and simply decide to be/act the part of who they want to be.  A good person.  A successful person etc.  In this way you do not get too bogged down in goal setting.

For example, for a while as a teenager I was dealing with some other serious mental health issues, didn't have friends, spent all my time at school or at my shitty fast food job, and my family was in a big conflict and drinking all the time. I had to quit a hobby that was a huge passion of mine. So I wound up spending a ton of time on forums related to the hobby, and actually writing stories about people who participate in the hobby.

In those stories, my characters were successful, had good relationships with others, and found love. In real life, I was alone and felt like I had hit a dead end. While I was washing dishes at work and they just kept piling up, I'd be thinking about the story I wanted to write, running through different ways of presenting it. When I came home to a quiet house at night, I would have my characters to keep me company. Plus, I got positive feedback from strangers on the Internet who read my stories, which felt wonderful.

I always kept up with school and I did participate in other real-life activities. It started to end when I wound up making a few new friends through those activities, and when an old friend reached out to re-kindle our relationship. From there, I re-learned how to socialize and the stories in my head just weren't as interesting anymore. I also received my acceptance to college, which gave me a plan and some hope for my future.

Sometimes I miss it a little. I think I was a better writer back then. But, all in all, I recognize that what really gives me hope and pulls me in is my connections with other people, which I can't really form if I'm living in a different world.",4,1609612446.0,t3_koycbz,False

You are far from weak. You are courageous for pouring your heart out to the world. To me, that‚Äôs magical. Vulnerability is strength. 

I know you may feel a great deal of darkness, but the best things happen in the dark. It allows a period for miracles, and huge transformations. Think of a seed that grows underneath the soil in order to thrive as the plant it was born to be, or the metamorphosis of the butterfly. We too, have similar life stages that we go and grow through. New beginnings will welcome you as you move to the next chapter of your life. Leaving behind what is familiar and moving towards the unknown can be frightening, but trust that you are on the right path. Choose to make your days feel purposeful, and most importantly continue to allow yourself to feel what you feel. Authenticity will take you far, just be sure to not get stuck in those sticky feelings. Let those thoughts/emotions come and go like the waves of the sea. Crashing, breaking, and continuously being reborn.

While there are things wrong with my brain that can't be fixed easily or at all, like the autism and various traumas, I feel like nearly all of my major depression crashes are caused by lack of money or could be prevented by money not being an issue. I feel like shit about myself for not being able to work. I worry when my husband is stressed over work, and whether they'll do something to screw him over one day. When he is tired and frustrated over work stuff he's more likely to be in a bad mood, which sets off my anxiety, which at least sometimes leads to pointless arguing because neither of us cope well.

Healthy food costs more money than crap food, at least if you want it to taste good. And if you're worried about paying rent, it's safer to buy cheap food that doesn't expire quickly because you can't afford to waste anything.

And lack of money also makes it way harder to keep in touch with friends and family. Nobody has time to hang out because most work shitty jobs with random work schedules, and if you have family far away, going to see them gets expensive really fast. And humans are extremely social animals, we absolutely need our social groups to stay healthy, mentally and physically.

And me and husband are still financially better off than many people. Stuff like this still plays a big part in my depression, while I'm also likely prone to mental illness due to genes and shit.

I have a close knit circle of friends (I don't associate with my family very often), a good job (that I might get fired from), physical health, and a comfortable living situation (although I'm plagued with credit card debt). Despite the objectively good things I have in my life, every morning I wake up and have to will myself to get out of bed to go to work. I hate myself frankly. I make so many mistakes. I can't keep a relationship because I have a history of being emotionally abusive to people I love. I'm naturally an asshole and have to actively resist it every minute of my life. I'm selfish. Judgemental. My best friend tells me I'm the most intelligent person he knows and I don't see why. No smart person could fuck up so much like I do. I only have a good career because I'm lucky, not because I worked for it.

One of my best friends has really disassociated from the world and she believes no one cares about her (she has never been able to keep friends long term) and I do all I can to show her that I care about her and will not give up on her. I see so much value in her.

She doesn't reply to my texts very often these days but it doesn't stop me from sending a meme every couple of days because I know she reads it and laughs. It's the best I can do.

I‚Äôm 24 and grew up in a verbal and mentally abusive home. Constant yelling, criticism, belittling. My dad is Bipolar, and my Mom would escape him by working all the time. So we were home with him A LOT. 
He was an alcoholic until he had a stroke my freshman year of High School. 
I have flashbacks. I feel so much sadness for tiny me. I was in maybe 3rd grade when my Dad lost a piece of paper with something important written on it. 
He was screaming at me to find it. Screaming. He was in the army so he had this military scream and was in my face screaming over and over again ‚ÄúFind it!‚Äù 
When i couldn‚Äôt he put his hands around my neck and started choking me and lifted me off the floor. 
I was maybe 8, or 9. 
I still remember being choked and hoping my baby brother or baby sister weren‚Äôt looking. But I looked over at them and they were standing at the door scared.

I stopped caring though a while ago and now when I get good or bad grades it's for me and me alone. I don't want fake affection which depends on conditions.

It's totally okay if you need to do summer school! You're still completing it and moving forward. 

As for your parents, you might want to send them articles or memes or whatever regarding depression. It helps a lot more than talking because you're still a ""kid"" in their eyes and think you have no idea what you're talking about. They still might not listen, but it's a less confrontational way to educate those who are ignorant and quick to temper. 

Also, make sure you line up appointments with a therapist and psychiatrist if you haven't. Having a family who dismisses you and ignores your mental health can cause a relapse. Having them alright lined up and having an established relationship really, really helps.

hqaeih,fxx65cw,nightmehrr,"Yes, it is very likely. Having lived with a toxic mother for 20 years now, I believe that experiencing hatred, anger, and insecurity one in a while is common to everyone but living in a household with toxic parents can make it difficult for one to address negative emotions and become more self-aware. Over the years, children living with toxic parents usually develop a pattern of bottling up their feelings or begin looking for validation outside through attention-seeking or people-pleasing behaviors. Following such a pattern over a long duration of time can make children extremely vulnerable to any negative stimulus that might trigger mental health disorder/s. I think the best way to keep your mental health in check is to either take therapy or gradually take up activities like journaling, exercising, meditating, and making them a part of your daily routine. Set realistic expectations from yourself and understand that **you are a work in progress**. **You are more than your parents' opinion of you** and have the capability of working towards your development irrespective of the circumstances.

My mother would gaslight me *a lot.* It was always my fault for something happening in some way shape or form. But when she needed me to lie about something I was the best child, her favorite. Of course I did when I was young because I wanted her approval, I wanted moms love. That's dug me into a pit of self loathing, anger, and insecurity about my relationships with people. I usually only think people want to be around be because of what they can gain from it. I'm **extremely** skeptical of everyone that talks to me. I never had anything violent happen to me though, it was all mental abuse.

I hope you're okay at the moment love, and you can get through this. It takes a lot of time and effort to figure out how to understand human connections work, but it's worth it. I ended up going to years of therapy to try and rewire my brain into thinking people might want to be around me because they like me. Therapy might be something to look into when you can, there is always something you can take away from therapy. Also don't be afraid to ""shop around"" for therapists.

fnylu3,flcm3ji,None,"I'm so sorry about the person you lost. ): She sounds like she was really precious to you.

It's important to keep important people in our hearts, but I think you are doing her a disservice by allowing her memory to cast a shadow over your life instead of lighting it up. She used to light your world up. Let her memory do the same.

Any new girl you meet will not be your old girlfriend. She will never be the same. That said, it doesn't mean she won't be just as wonderful in her own way. I'm sure you know this logically, even if you don't really feel like it's true right now. It is normal and healthy and GOOD to move on after the loss of a loved one. She is not being replaced. You are not disrespecting her memory. You can still love her while continuing to live your own life. It's hard, but it's so important.

Counselling isn't for everyone, but I really think you should look into it, or keep talking to us anonymously if you are struggling to find affordable counselling. Talking can really help. It's also important to talk to this new girl and let her know how you are feeling, and why you have these reservations right now. This is important because she deserved to know why you are acting strangley towards her, and it may also help you to pull down that barrier between your past and your future.

At the moment it sounds like you are at risk of developing some really unhealthy coping mechanisms for this stress. Don't become a workaholic, please. It'll only fuck things up for you. If you think this is a risk, you should speak to your boss and ask them to help you out/keep an eye on you if you seem low. Having someone in your team looking out for you is really important. Working in order to avoid life is NOT a solution. It's a means of escape. It's ok to escape sometimes, but please don't let it be all the time, or things will never get better.

Keep the money you got at least, don't be a foolish vagabond if anything.

I don't know where you are, where you're from, but if you ask this question people will give an answer. If you ask this question enough times regardless of their answer, they'll stop caring.

> If I just leave, I can find a job somewhere. Idk. That would take like two weeks if I start now, and with some luck. If I stay, I poison everything and drown. 

You can find a job now. Ever walked onto a farm and asked someone if they needed an extra hand? You might get a job. Ever worked construction and had two nails go through your boot, and had to walk it off to finish the rest of an 8 hour day? Ever had a log slammed in your face on accident? Anyways, nothing will be poisoned if you stayed. I get the sentiment though.

> The one person I go to is avoiding me. I think she‚Äôs in the funk too. I can‚Äôt get mad at her. I have to respect that. So right now, no.

Honestly? Is a bouta' a girl?

> I actually forgot to add that too. I can‚Äôt connect with anyone ,I can‚Äôt communicate anymore. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm speaking another language.

You communicate well enough here.

My mom was depressed and my dad was always really angry.. So my brain just sort of assumed it was me I guess and I carried that inner dialogue into adulthood. 
But now I'm learning to love myself.. And live in the moment. I've realized my parents were probably just like me at a younger age.. Just trying to figure things out and survive, and God only knows wtf their parents did to them, you know? So I don't blame them. 
Now, I try to recognize when that voice is saying something that isn't right, and that makes me feel bad. And I ignore it. And the more and more I do it, the better I get at recognizing it, and not feeling bad. 
I've learned that's called neuroplasticity. Anything done in repetition will change the shape of your brain. And that grey matter up there will adapt and become more efficient (as it does) at living a good life, the more I practice.

Honestly screw that guy. What's really bad is that he kept his ""lack of compassion"" and emotions a secret from you and that's one of the most dishonest things someone could do. Even though you're not married, you guys were a team and he has a duty to you and he failed. 

> I feel so hurt because many times at the beginning of my diagnosis, I told him to leave me so that I didn‚Äôt have to drag him into this life and he always promised me he wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way. 

When someone says this they should **fucking mean it.** 

I hope you get the help you need and if you ever need a rant or someone to talk to PM me any time x

9xnkc5,e9ugg2x,workerdaemon,"I'm really sorry this has happened to you. What he has done is unquestionably cruel.

I went through a similar experience, so I may be able to give you some insight as to what may have happened.

I suddenly had a severe migraine every single day. No one could figure out where it came from, and no one had a clue how to treat it. I was in abject suffering. Before then, I had struggled greatly with my mental health, difficulty holding a job, hysterics, the whole nine yards. But I finally got on medications and was stabilizing... only to have the rug pulled out from under me with these atrocious migraines.

I had been with my partner for 5 years at that point. I really thought we were going to get married; it was just unquestioned. I thought it was in the bag. And as a sort of coping method for my never-ending pain I fantasized about an engagement ring and was considering designing one. I didn't keep this to myself, I occasionally mentioned it to my partner.

A couple months into my excruciating migraines, my partner dropped the bomb: he said he didn't know he wanted to marry me. He wasn't sure he could stay with me and all my problems for the rest of his life.

I was utterly devastated. Beyond devastated. I actually mentally broke -- definitely a borderline personality reaction. For the next year I suffered severe memory loss (I lost the entire month of May), and random expensive shopping trips during black outs. It actually took me most of the year before I even discovered these blank spots in my memory and understood why random shopping bags were in my bedroom.

What *I did* notice, however, was that I lost all emotion towards my partner. Just, nothing was there. No love. No hate. Nothing. He was a blank slate. I was really confused. Due to my mental break, I couldn't connect it to him telling me he wasn't sure he could marry me. To me, at the time, it seemed as though my emotions had slowly faded away.

Fortunately, the two of us are very slow acting, cautious people. We didn't take action when he said he didn't know he wanted to marry me. We just kept going, while I was being churned up inside over the horror of losing my partner... because of me. Because I am so unstable. Because I cause this person I love so dearly to suffer just by being around me.

Turns out my emotions had shut off. As an automatic defensive mechanism, my brain prepared itself for my partner making the final decision to leave me so it would hurt less. My brain was trying to get me to leave him, saying he's meaningless to me, nothing. I can leave him and feel nothing, so why don't I just go ahead and break up with him? 

It was all an automatic defensive response to protect me from the pain of losing a person who I thought loved me unconditionally. With a borderline personality, my brain automatically jumped to protect me from seeing how I was unlovable, how I hurt those who love me.

It took almost a year to figure out what was going on. We went to couple's counseling, and couldn't find anything wrong with our relationship. He was stressed about my illness -- understandable -- and my emotions had mysteriously turned off.

Of course, once I figured out what was happening I quickly descended into suicidal planning. I hurt the person I love merely because of his own love towards me, how could I live with myself? I couldn't get myself to break up with him. I was horrified I was such an awful person that my love couldn't love me, too. 

I climbed out of that suicidal hole and gave him an ultimatum. I told him I was being destroyed by not knowing if he could stay with me or not. I couldn't break up with him, so he had to decide: can he live with me? If not, he's gotta break up with me so I can move on. I gave him a month to think it over (we're *really* slow at things).

After the month I asked him. He said he didn't want to live forever with the way things are... but he also was incapable of breaking up with me. It's like we're stuck. We can't leave each other.

That was 5 and a half years ago, and we're married now. Very quickly after that talk we fell deeply in love again. I think it was essentially the *limitation of choice* that actually *freed us* to love each other. We took splitting up off the table as an option, and consequently only focused on solving problems. 

Ok, so how does my story apply to you?

Basically, your partner appears to be experiencing what I went through. But instead of me fearing my partner will leave me, he is fearing the reality that his partner could die.

It is quite possible that his brain has turned off his emotions towards you as an automatic defense mechanism. I was extremely confused when this happened to me, so he is likely *extremely* confused about why it could have happened to him. But it is an automatic response that the conscious mind is rarely aware of. It takes introspective experience to identify these sorts of defenses and more experience to know how to break the defense down.

His piss poor reactions and out bursts could also be an automatic defensive response. His emotions may have turned off at first, but still the horror of death could have seeped through effectively triggering his flight response. And so he tried to get you to hate him to burn the bridge so he doesn't have to experience your death.

This is tragic. It is a damn fucking shame he doesn't have the wherewithal to be aware of what he is doing, stopping himself, and trying to find out what is going on and why he is acting out of character.

There is a possibility that the cruelty of what he has done to you will hit him and he'll come back to you apologising profusely, and may even ask to come back.

You'll need to decide what to do if that happens. He could be like my husband and figure out a way through so you can be together until the end. Or, he could be like my ex-boyfriend and dump you again at the drop of a hat several more times.

You should plan now what you want to do if he comes back.

* Exclude him from your life
* Stay as only friends
* Get back together, but never again if he leaves you a second time
* Get back together, but never again if he leaves you a third time (""three strikes you're out"" rule)

What path you decide will depend upon *your* mental health. What can *you* handle? How much does it effect you when he leaves? How much does it take to regain some semblance of normalcy? How much time do you have to live, and how much drama do you want to risk him bringing into your remaining life?

These are questions you should try to answer ahead of time so you have a set of guidelines to follow when in an overwhelmingly passionate moment.

1jfzto8,miviopn,TheConnectionCouch,"Hi I am a Licensed Professional Counselor and Certified Trauma and Sex therapist. I just want to start by saying I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through this. What you‚Äôre feeling is completely valid, and surviving sexual assault‚Äîespecially by someone in the public eye‚Äîcan add layers of trauma, powerlessness, and isolation that make healing feel even harder. The fact that you‚Äôre reaching out and putting this into words is already a huge step, and you deserve support as you navigate this.

I strongly encourage you to reach out to a trauma-informed therapist who can walk with you through this healing process. EMDR, somatic therapy, or other trauma-focused approaches can help process what happened in a way that doesn‚Äôt keep you stuck in survival mode. If therapy feels too big right now, even reaching out to a crisis line or a trusted person in your life could be a way to start feeling less alone.

You are not broken, and your response to trauma is not a reflection of your worth. Healing is possible, even if it feels far away right now. You deserve care, safety, and support. Please be gentle with yourself.

What you're describing sounds like derealization. It is similar to depersonalization and dissociation, all of which stem most commonly from depression, anxiety, and trauma. 

If you would like to talk privately in a bit more detail, I would be happy to. Otherwise, as others have said, mindfulness exercises and other grounding techniques can help in the moment. They will only help to bring you back, though, and will not necessarily keep it from continuing to happen.",20,1594480159.0,t3_hp8m4w,False
hp8m4w,fxobev7,difficult_tree,"There‚Äôs a couple of things this may be. Using mindfulness practices will help you better understand what your experience is.

One could be dissociation. This derives from a fear based response, to ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù. While it doesn‚Äôt feel like fear, dissociation is a learned experience - when people are the main source of our pain, we cope by disconnecting. If I don‚Äôt need you, you can‚Äôt harm me, and then I am safe. 

Another possible cause is numbing. Think of your emotions like the volume on the radio. Turning it up really loud means having ‚Äúloud‚Äù feelings. This could come through as violence, aggression, song writing, painting, music, dance or other external expressions. Turning it ‚Äúdown‚Äù could be numbness, social self-exclusion, substance use, over sleeping, or other activities that help you disconnect from others like gaming or casual sex. 

To answer your question - yes this is a common experience for many with and without mental illness. I guess it depends what you want to do with this feeling. Do you want to change it? Accept it? Find a way of intercepting it?",14,1594477207.0,t3_hp8m4w,False

I want you to know that I had to take time out to my life to understand life, and the point of everything. I don't 'do' things because everyone is doing them, I need to understand why. That included life. I had to understand why every being wanted to live. I did find the answers, and the point of life is to be happy. It's about spending time with people you care about, It's about doing things that make you happy, It's about doing your best, and living your best life! You need to become sensitive to emotions again. Emotions guide you, and tell you how you feel.  


There was a time when I wondered if everything was real as well, I then started living life based on how I felt, because I knew that was real, my love was real, you know?

Every day spent like that felt like I was digging myself deeper and I was well aware of that at the time but you're kind of totally unmotivated to do anything when you're that depressed. I have no real problem getting out of bed now or doing the bare necessities from day to day. But I don't really feel excited about anything. Everything is just kind of boring. Sometimes it's like I forget about it though and enjoy watching a movie or something. I might even get brief moments of hope for the future and I get this good feeling that feels awfully familiar. Kind of like some form of nostalgia for the feelings of being genuinely happy or at least not being unhappy in the past. It's hard to explain...  


I got a bunch of things to actually be happy about. So I kind of feel bad sometimes that I don't. There's a lot of people out there in way worse situations than me but that doesn't really help me with coping with my own depression. I just feel like every day is an equation that adds the sum of the events from that day and you either have a net gain or loss in happiness. And over time you either get better or worse in small incremental steps, so you're not really aware of what way you're going or what is working. I try to listen to my feelings but I'm not even sure that I interpret them correctly. Feeling hungry often makes me nauseous as I don't get the urge to eat and just go hungry instead. And when I actually eat then it's not satisfying or anything. I just eat because I know I have to. I procrastinate stuff I'm anxious about even though I know I will feel better when I take care of them. Like showering for example. I can smell terrible and hate to be around myself for a day or two and sometimes even a week... And know that it will get better if I just shower. But why the hell can't I just motivate myself to take those 10-30 minutes and not feel like crap for days on end? It's like I'm doing this to myself and I'm totally aware of it and I still can't just do more than the bare minimum.

This is a side effect of a sickness that you have (depression), like any other sicknesses.

I had to find out/build out those things again. I vividly remember telling this to a friend and him telling me ""you're a decent person, and a smart person, if this is happening to you it's happening to a lot of other people too, you're not the first."" This had strangely comforted me, like knowing that this wasn't a weird thing I was doing to myself or that I was failing at that was my fault, you know? Same applies to you.
